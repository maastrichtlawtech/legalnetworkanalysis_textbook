    "\n",
    "Software has been developed for specific use cases. The advantage of such software is that it is optimized for that use case and that it requires a low level of technical knowledge in order to use the software. The disadvantage is that the platform is designed for a specific purpose, which restricts the freedom in terms of adding or removing functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of this type of software concerns Case Law Explorer. This platform has been developed for those who wish to conduct network analysis on case law. It has automated the process from searching to the calculation of the network statistics and the visualization of the network. A link to the software and to the user guide of the software can be found [here](https://www.caselawexplorer.tech/).\n",

    "General purpose software allows applying network analysis to different types of data. The advantage of this type of software is that it can be applied in a number of contexts and for a variety of purposes, whereas the disadvantage is that the functionalities are generic and not tailored to a specific use case."

    "1. Go to the Overview tab. You should now see your network.\n",
    "2. Run the ForceAtlas 2 layout algorithm in Layout. Note that every layout algorithm can be tweaked by changing parameters. You can play around with the ‘Scaling’ and ‘Prevent overlap’ parameters.\n",
    "3.  Calculate the centralities by running ‘Average degree’ in the Statistics tab. Gephi will show you the degree distributions, but will also add the results to the dataset in Data Laboratory. You may also run ‘Network Diameter’,\twhich\tgives\tyou various centrality measures based on network diameter, including betweenness centrality. \n",
    "4. Change the node size based on the centrality measure of our preference,We visualize the nodes with a higher in-degree by increasing their size. Click on ‘Nodes’ in the Appearance tab, then click the ![images](images/ch5/sizebutton.png) (size) button and choose ‘Ranking’. Select ‘In-Degree’ from the drop-down attribute menu and click Apply. \n",
    "5. Filter the network. You can, for instance, visualize the network of the 50 most central cases (based on in-degree). Go to Data Laboratory and determine the in-degree of the 50th most central case. Then go back to Overview and open the Filters window. Expand the Attributes filter category and select ‘Range’, then double click on ‘In-Degree’. Finally, adjust the indegree range and click Filter. Click Stop to proceed with the next part. \n",
    "6. Calculate the community structure. Run ‘Modularity’ in the Statistics tab.\n",
    "7. Adjust the appearance. Recolor the communities by clicking on ‘Nodes’ in the Appearance tab, then click the ![image.png](images/ch5/colorbutton.png) (color) button and choose ‘Partition’. Select ‘Modularity Class’ from the drop-down attribute menu and click Apply. \n",
    "8. Filter for certain communities. Choose a community and layout again. Open the Filters window. Expand the Partition filter category and double click on ‘Modularity Class’. Finally, select a community to display and click Filter. \n",
