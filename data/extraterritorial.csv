transferring them to speedboats off the canary islands for subsequent delivery to the coasts of europe in diplomatic note dated june in response to request from the french embassy in phnom penh_ the cambodian minister for foreign affairs and international cooperation gave his government agreement for the french authorities to take action_ in the following terms the ministry of foreign affairs and international cooperation presents its compliments to the french embassy in phnom penh and_ referring to its note no dated june has the honour formally to confirm that the royal government of cambodia authorises the french authorities to intercept_ inspect and take legal action against the ship winner_ flying the cambodian flag xudj belonging to sherlock marine in the marshall islands the ministry of foreign affairs and international cooperation takes this opportunity to renew its assurance of its high esteem in diplomatic telegram dated the same day_ the french embassy in phnom penh passed on the information to the ministry of defence in paris the commander of the french frigate lieutenant de vaisseau le hénaff_ which lay at anchor in brest harbour and had been assigned mission off the coast of africa_ was instructed by the french naval authorities to locate and intercept the winner the frigate left brest harbour the same day to search for and intercept the winner_ with the french navy commando unit jaubert_ special forces team specialised in boarding vessels at sea_ on board for the duration of the mission on june during technical stopover in spain_ three experts from the ocrtis also boarded the frigate on june at the french frigate spotted merchant ship travelling at slow speed through the waters off cape verde_ several thousand kilometres from france it was not flying flag_ but was identified as the winner the merchant ship suddenly changed course and began to steer course that was dangerous both for the frigate and for members of the armed forces who had boarded speedboat while the winner refused to answer the attempts of the commander of the frigate to establish radio contact_ its crew jettisoned number of packages into the sea one of the packages_ containing about kilos of cocaine_ was recovered by the french seamen after several warnings and warning shots fired under orders from france maritime prefect for the atlantic went unheeded_ the french frigate fired shot directly at the winner the merchant ship then answered by radio and agreed to stop when they boarded the winner_ the french commando team used their weapons to open certain locked doors when crew member of the winner refused to obey their commands_ warning shot was fired at the ground_ but the bullet ricocheted and the crew member was wounded he was immediately evacuated onto the french frigate_ then transferred to dakar hospital_ where he died week later under orders from the maritime prefect and at the request of the public prosecutor in brest_ tug with military doctor on board was sent from brest to tow the winner back to brest harbour_ escorted by the frigate commandant bouan because of its poor state of repair and the weather conditions_ the ship was incapable of speeds faster than knots the crew of the winner were confined to their quarters under military guard the government submit that when the crew had calmed down they were allowed to move about the ship under the supervision of the french forces according to the applicants_ the coercive measures were maintained throughout the voyage_ until they arrived in brest on june at the brest public prosecutor referred the case to ocrtis for examination under the flagrante delicto procedure it emerged that the greek coastguard had had the winner under observation in connection with international drug trafficking involving greek nationals on june the brest public prosecutor office opened an investigation into charges_ against persons unknown_ of leading group with the aim of producing_ making_ importing_ exporting_ transporting_ holding_ supplying_ selling_ acquiring or illegally using drugs and conspiring to import and export drugs illegally two investigating judges were appointed on june at the winner entered brest harbour under escort the crew were handed over to the police_ acting under instructions dated june from one of the investigating judges_ who immediately notified the persons concerned that they were being placed in police custody and informed them of their rights on the same day_ the applicants were presented to an investigating judge at the police station in brest_ to determine whether or not their police custody should be extended the reports submitted to the grand chamber by the government show that certain applicants met one of the investigating judges andré at mr cabrera leon mr sage martínez mr balaban mr manolache mr petcu and mr dodica and the other applicants mr medvedyev_ mr bilenikin and mr boreas were heard by the second investigating judge simier at an unspecified time the applicants were presented to the same investigating judges again the following day_ june mr sage martínez at mr cabrera leon at mr manolache at mr balaban at mr dodica at and mr petcu at the times for the other three applicants are not known on and june the applicants were charged and remanded in custody pending trial mr petcu_ mr dodica_ mr balaban and mr manolache on june_ and mr medvedyev_ mr bilenikin_ mr boreas_ mr cabrera leon_ mr sage martínez and two other crew members mr litetski and mr theophanous on june the applicants applied to the investigation division of the rennes court of appeal to have the evidence disallowed_ submitting that the french authorities had acted ultra vires in boarding the winner_ as the ship had been under cambodian jurisdiction and cambodia was not party to the united nations convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances signed in vienna on december and also that they had not been brought promptly before judge_ as required under article of the convention_ when the winner was intercepted in judgment of october the court dismissed their appeal and held that there were no grounds for disallowing the evidence after retracing the details of the operations_ including the fact that on june at the french frigate spotted merchant ship first on its radar_ then visually travelling at slow speed and flying no flag_ and identified it as the winner it pronounced judgment in the following terms considering that the international effort to combat drug trafficking is governed by three conventions the united nations single convention on narcotic drugs of march the united nations convention on the law of the sea_ signed at montego bay on december and the united nations convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances_ signed in vienna on december while france has signed and ratified all three conventions_ cambodia has not signed the vienna convention_ article of which provides for derogations from the traditional principle of the law of the flag state considering that the applicants wrongly suggest in this case that in keeping with the traditional rule codified in article of the montego bay convention_ the authority of state on ships on the high seas flying its flag is both full and exclusive and that coercion may be used to ensure that the rules of international law and the state own law are respected as article of that convention_ on illicit traffic in narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances stipulates all states shall cooperate in the suppression of illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances engaged in by ships on the high seas contrary to international conventions any state which has reasonable grounds for believing that ship flying its flag is engaged in illicit traffic in narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances may request the cooperation of other states to suppress such traffic considering that_ based on that text and with reference to the earlier united nations convention of march against international drug trafficking_ the french authorities were within their rights to request cambodia cooperation with view to obtaining that country authorisation to intercept the winner in order to put stop to the drug trafficking in which all or part of its crew was suspected of being involved that as the provisions of the vienna convention do not apply to cambodia_ it was for that state to ask the french authorities for all the relevant information concerning the alleged drug trafficking to enable it to assess the merits of the request using its unfettered discretion that the diplomatic telegram sent by the french embassy on june which actually mentions the reasoned request submitted by the ocrtis_ suffices to establish the existence of an agreement given without restrictions or reservations by the government of cambodia for the planned interception and all its consequences_ and is authoritative until proven otherwise that on this point the applicants cannot contend that the document does not meet the formal requirements of article of the vienna convention concerning bilateral agreements between parties_ when they are also arguing that the vienna convention is not applicable to cambodia because it has not signed it and that the value of the diplomatic document is not affected by the fact that the accused did not know the exact status of the person who signed the message or the person who transmitted the cambodian government agreement to the french embassy considering_ on the other hand_ that in proceeding to intercept the winner it was the duty of the french authorities to comply with the procedures provided for both in the vienna convention signed by france in particular to take due account of the need not to endanger the safety of life at sea_ the security of the vessel and its cargo and in the law of july as amended by the law of april adapting french law to article of the vienna convention_ articles et seq of which define the sphere of competence of commanders of naval vessels and the procedures for the search_ reporting_ prosecution and judgment in the french courts of drug trafficking offences committed at sea considering that the reports drawn up by the commander of the lieutenant de vaisseau le hénaff_ duly authorised by the maritime prefect for the atlantic_ which are authoritative until proven otherwise_ state that when the frigate drew within sight of the winner_ off the cape verde islands_ the merchant ship was flying no flag and its captain not only failed to answer the requests to identify his ship_ in breach of the rules of international law_ and to stop his ship_ but responded aggressively with series of dangerous manoeuvres that jeopardised the safety of the french frigate and the lives of the sailors on board the speedboat that it was also reported that the crew of the winner were seen to be throwing suspicious parcels overboard_ one of which was recovered and found to contain large quantity of cocaine that all these elements together amounted to reasonable grounds for the commander of the frigate to suspect that he was in the presence of drug traffickers who had jettisoned their cargo before attempting to escape and that by using force to board the winner and taking appropriate coercive measures to control the crew and confine them to their cabins and to take over and sail the ship_ the commander of the frigate acted in strict compliance with the provisions of article of the vienna convention under which_ if evidence of involvement in illicit traffic is found after ship has been boarded and searched_ appropriate action may be taken with respect to the vessel and the persons and cargo on board_ the provisions of the law of july as supplemented by the law of april which_ in its general provisions articles to regulates recourse to coercive measures comprising_ if necessary_ the use of force in the event of refusal by ship to submit to control and also_ in the particular case of the fight against drug trafficking articles to makes provision for the implementation of the control and coercion measures provided for under international law considering that_ regard being had to the distinctly aggressive conduct of the captain of the winner in attempting to evade inspection by the french naval authorities_ and to the attitude of the crew members_ who took advantage of the time thus gained to eliminate any traces of the drug trafficking by deliberately throwing the evidence overboard_ the members of the commando unit who boarded the ship found themselves in the presence of large scale international trafficking and were likely at any moment to come up against hostile and potentially dangerous crew who could threaten the security of their mission that they were obliged to use their weapons in response to the resistance put up by one of the ship crew that it cannot be claimed that article of the law of july as amended provides only for administrative assistance measures and excludes any form of coercion in respect of people when it stipulates in general terms that the competent maritime authorities are authorised to carry out or have carried out the inspection and coercion measures provided for in international law and article of the vienna convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances expressly mentions taking appropriate action with respect to the persons on board that although the nature of these measures is not specified_ the text at least provides for the possibility for the competent naval authorities to limit_ if necessary_ the freedom of the boarded ship crew to come and go_ otherwise the provision would be meaningless and the safety of the men taking over control of the ship would be seriously jeopardised that it cannot be ruled out in the course of such operations against international drug traffickers on the high seas that the crew may have weapons hidden away and may seek to regain control of the ship by force that consequently_ confining the members of the crew of the winner all but the wounded man_ who was transferred to the frigate to their cabins under the guard of the commando unit_ so that the ship could be safely taken over and rerouted_ fell within the appropriate measures provided for in article of the vienna convention considering that the law of july necessarily requires some departure from ordinary criminal procedure to allow for the specific needs of the effort to combat drug trafficking by ships on the high seas_ in keeping with the rules of international law_ and for the fact that it is impossible in practice_ bearing in mind the time needed to sail to the new port of destination_ to apply the ordinary rules governing detention and the right to be brought promptly before judge and_ that being so_ that the restrictions placed on the movements of the boarded ship crew_ as authorised in such cases by the united nations convention signed in vienna on december were not at variance with article of the european convention on human rights and did not amount to unlawful detention and that it should be noted that as soon as the winner docked in brest_ its crew were handed over to the police_ immediately informed of their rights and placed in custody_ then brought before the investigating judge considering also that the french courts have jurisdiction under the law of july as amended the grounds of nullity must accordingly be rejected and there is no reason to disallow any other documents from the proceedings_ which are lawful in judgment of january the court of cassation dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicants in the following terms in so far as cambodia_ the flag state_ expressly and without restriction authorised the french authorities to stop the winner and_ in keeping with article of the vienna convention_ only appropriate action was taken against the persons on board_ who were lawfully taken into police custody as soon as they landed on french soil_ the investigation division has justified its decision on may the ille et vilaine special assize court found three applicants mr boreas_ mr sage martínez and mr cabrera leon and one other crew member_ guilty of conspiracy to illegally attempt to import narcotics and sentenced them respectively to twenty years ten years three years and eighteen years imprisonment however_ mr boreas and were acquitted of the charge of leading or organising gang for the purposes of drug trafficking the assize court acquitted the other six applicants and another crew member_ of the charges against them in judgment of july the loire atlantique assize court_ examining an appeal lodged by mr boreas_ mr sage martínez and upheld the conviction and sentenced them respectively to twenty_ twelve and seventeen years imprisonment on april the court of cassation dismissed an appeal on points of law lodged by and mr boreas in note of september in reply to request submitted by the french embassy in phnom penh on september the ministry of foreign affairs and international cooperation of cambodia confirmed that its diplomatic note of june had indeed authorised the french authorities to intercept and carry

and without intimidation the timetable and programme for the political process and benefit from reconstruction and rehabilitation activities the transfer of authority to the iraqi interim government on june full authority was transferred from the cpa to the iraqi interim government and the cpa ceased to exist subsequently_ the multinational force_ including the british forces forming part of it_ remained in iraq pursuant to requests by the iraqi government and authorisations from the united nations security council united kingdom armed forces in iraq from may to june during this period_ the coalition forces consisted of six divisions that were under the overall command of us generals four were us divisions and two were multinational each division was given responsibility for particular geographical area of iraq the united kingdom was given command of the multinational division south east which comprised the provinces of basra_ maysan_ thi qar and al muthanna_ an area of square kilometres with population of million there were coalition troops_ including united kingdom troops_ stationed in the multinational division south east the main theatre for operations by united kingdom forces in the multinational division south east were the basra and maysan provinces_ with total population of about million people just over british troops were deployed there_ of whom just over had operational from may onwards british forces in iraq carried out two main functions the first was to maintain security in the multinational division south east area_ in particular in the basra and maysan provinces the principal security task was the effort to re establish the iraqi security forces_ including the iraqi police other tasks included patrols_ arrests_ anti terrorist operations_ policing of civil demonstrations_ protection of essential utilities and infrastructure and protecting police stations the second main function of the british troops was the support of the civil administration in iraq in variety of ways_ from liaison with the cpa and governing council of iraq and local government_ to assisting with the rebuilding of the infrastructure in the aitken report see paragraph below prepared on behalf of the army chief of general staff_ the post conflict situation in iraq was described as follows the context in which operations have been conducted in iraq has been exceptionally complex it is not for this report to comment on the jus ad bellum aspects of the operation_ nor of the public opinions of the invasion it is_ however_ important to note that the alliance post invasion plans concentrated more on the relief of humanitarian disaster which did not_ in the event_ occur on anything like the scale that had been anticipated and less on the criminal activity and subsequent insurgency that actually took place one consequence of that was that we had insufficient troops in theatre to deal effectively with the situation in which we found ourselves peace support operations require significantly larger numbers of troops to impose law and order than are required for prosecuting war ours were very thinly spread on the ground in his investigation in april of the breadbasket incident alleged abuse of iraqis detained on suspicion of looting humanitarian aid stores brigadier carter described conditions in iraq thus may some four weeks or so after british forces had started to begin the transition from offensive operations to stabilisation the situation was fluid battlegroups had been given geographic areas of responsibility based generally around their initial tactical objectives combat operations had officially ended_ and the rules of engagement had changed to reflect this_ but there was rising trend of shooting incidents although these were principally between iraqis_ seeking to settle old scores or involved in criminal activity_ there were early indications that the threat to british soldiers was developing the structure of the british forces was changing many of the heavier capabilities that had been required for the invasion were now being sent home some force elements were required for operations elsewhere_ and there was pressure from the uk to downsize quickly to more sustainable numbers local attitudes were also changing initially ecstatic with happiness_ the formerly downtrodden shia population in and around basra had become suspicious_ and by the middle of may people were frustrated aspirations and expectations were not being met there was no iraqi administration or governance fuel and potable water were in short supply_ electricity was intermittent_ and the hospitals were full of wounded from the combat operations phase bridges and key routes had been destroyed by coalition bombing law and order had completely collapsed the iraqi police service had melted away the few security guards who remained were old and incapable and the iraqi armed forces had been captured_ disbanded or deserted criminals had been turned out onto the streets and the prisons had been stripped the judiciary were in hiding every government facility had been raided and all loose items had been removed insecure buildings had been occupied by squatters crime was endemic and in parts of basra state of virtual anarchy prevailed hijackings_ child kidnappings_ revenge killings_ car theft and burglary were rife in very short space of time wealth was being comprehensively redistributed in this environment_ the british army was the sole agent of law and order within its area of operations when the association of chief police officers lead for international affairs_ mr paul kernaghan_ visited iraq in may he said that he would not recommend the deployment of civilian police officers to the theatre of operations due to the poor security situation the last time the army had exercised the powers of an army of occupation was in and it had spent many months preparing for that role in may the same soldiers who had just fought high intensity_ conventional war were expected to convert_ almost overnight_ into the only people capable of providing the agencies of government and humanitarian relief for the people of southern iraq battlegroups comprising lieutenant colonel and about soldiers were allocated areas of comprising hundreds of square miles companies major with about men under command were given whole towns to run the british invasion plans had wisely limited damaging as much of the physical infrastructure as possible but with only military personnel available to run that infrastructure_ and very limited local staff support_ the task placed huge strains on the army one of the effects of this lack of civil infrastructure was the conundrum british soldiers faced when dealing with routine crime our experience in northern ireland_ and in peace support operations around the world_ has inculcated the clear principle of police primacy when dealing with criminals in operational environments soldiers accept that they will encounter crime_ and that they will occasionally be required to arrest those criminals but despite some experience of this syndrome in kosovo in our doctrine and practice had not prepared us for dealing with those criminals when there was no civil police force_ no judicial system to deal with offenders_ and no prisons to detain them in even when nascent iraqi police force was re established in troops on the ground had little confidence in its ability to deal fairly or reasonably with any criminals handed over to it in hindsight_ we now know that some soldiers acted outside the law in the way they dealt with local criminals however diligent they were_ commanders were unable to be everywhere_ and so were physically unable to supervise their troops to the extent that they should as result_ when those instances did occur_ they were less likely to be spotted and prevented united kingdom military records show that_ as at june there had been approximately demonstrations and violent attacks against coalition forces in the multinational division south east since may the violent attacks consisted of anti aircraft attacks_ grenade attacks_ attacks using improvised explosive devices_ attempted attacks using improvised explosive devices_ mortar attacks_ rocket propelled grenade attacks_ shootings and others the same records show that_ between may and march iraqis were known to have been killed in incidents in which british troops used force the rules of engagement the use of force by british troops during operations is covered by the appropriate rules of engagement the rules of engagement governing the use of lethal force by british troops in iraq during the relevant period were the subject of guidance contained in card issued to every soldier_ known as card alpha card alpha set out the rules of engagement in the following terms card guidance for opening fire for service personnel authorised to carry arms and ammunition on dutygeneral guidance this guidance does not affect your inherent right to self defence however_ in all situations you are to use no more force than absolutely necessary firearms must only be used as last resort when guarding property_ you must not use lethal force other than for the protection of human life protection of human life you may only open fire against person if he she is committing or about to commit an act likely to endanger life and there is no other way to prevent the danger challenging challenge must be given before opening fire unless to do this would be to increase the risk of death or grave injury to you or any other persons other than the attacker or you or others in the immediate vicinity are under armed attack you are to challenge by shouting navy_ army_ air force_ stop or fire or words to that effect opening fire if you have to open fire you are to fire only aimed shots and fire no more rounds than are necessary and take all reasonable precautions not to injure anyone other than your target investigations into iraqi civilian deaths involving british soldiers the decision to refer an incident for investigation by the royal military police on june brigadier moore commander of the mechanised brigade in iraq from june to november issued formal policy on the investigation of shooting incidents this policy provided that all shooting incidents were to be reported and the divisional provost marshal was to be informed non commissioned officers from the royal military police were then to evaluate the incident and decide whether it fell within the rules of engagement if it was decided that the incident did come within the rules of engagement_ statements were to be recorded and completed bulletin submitted through the chain of command if the incident appeared to fall outside the rules of engagement and involved death or serious injury_ the investigation was to be handed to the special investigation branch of the royal military police see paragraph below by the divisional provost marshal at the earliest opportunity however_ brigadier moore decided that from july this policy should be revised the new policy required that all such incidents should be reported immediately by the soldier involved to the multinational division south east by means of serious incident report there would then be an investigation into the incident by the company commander or the soldier commanding officer in his evidence to the domestic courts_ brigadier moore explained that the form of an investigation into an incident would vary according to the security situation on the ground and the circumstances of the individual case generally_ it would involve the company commander or commanding officer taking statements from the members of the patrol involved_ and reviewing radio logs it might also include taking photographs of the scene sometimes there would be further investigation through meeting with the family tribe of the person killed investigations at unit level_ however_ would not include full forensic examination within the brigade_ we had no forensic capability if the commanding officer was satisfied_ on the basis of the information available to him_ that the soldier had acted lawfully and within the rules of engagement_ there was no requirement to initiate an investigation by the special investigation branch the commanding officer would record his decision in writing to brigadier moore if the commanding officer was not so satisfied_ or if he had insufficient information to arrive at decision_ he was required to initiate special investigation branch investigation between january and april there was further reconsideration of this policy_ prompted by the fact that the environment had become less hostile and also by the considerable media and parliamentary interest in incidents involving united kingdom forces in which iraqis had died on april new policy was adopted by the commander of the multinational division south east requiring all shooting incidents involving united kingdom forces which resulted in civilian being killed or injured to be investigated by the special investigation branch in exceptional cases_ the brigade commander could decide that an investigation was not necessary any such decision had to be notified to the commander of the multinational division south east in writing investigation by the royal military police special investigation branch the royal military police form part of the army and deploy with the army on operations abroad_ but have separate chain of command military police officers report to the provost marshal_ who reports to the adjutant general within the royal military police_ the special investigation branch is responsible for the investigation of serious crimes committed by members of the british forces while on service_ incidents involving contact between the military and civilians and any special investigations tasked to it_ including incidents involving civilian deaths caused by british soldiers to secure their practical independence on operations_ the special investigation branch deploy as entirely discrete units and are subject to their own chain of command_ headed by provost officers who are deployed on operations for this purpose investigations into iraqi civilian deaths involving british soldiers were triggered either by the special investigation branch being asked to investigate by the commanding officer of the units concerned or by the special investigation branch of its own initiative_ when it became aware of an incident by other means however_ the latter type of investigation could be terminated if the special investigation branch was instructed to stop by the provost marshal or the commanding officer of the unit involved special investigation branch investigations in iraq were hampered by number of difficulties_ such as security problems_ lack of interpreters_ cultural considerations for example_ the islamic practice requiring body to be buried within twenty four hours and left undisturbed for forty days the lack of pathologists and post mortem facilities_ the lack of records_ problems with logistics_ the climate and general working conditions the aitken report see paragraph below summarised the position as follows it was not only the combat troops who were overstretched in these circumstances the current military criminal justice system is relevant_ independent_ and fit for purpose but even the most effective criminal justice system will struggle to investigate_ advise on and prosecute cases where the civil infrastructure is effectively absent and so_ in the immediate aftermath of the ground war_ the service police faced particular challenges in gathering evidence of quality that would meet the very high standards required under english law national records usually an integral reference point for criminal investigations were largely absent different understanding of the law between iraqi people and british police added to an atmosphere of hostility and suspicion and the army was facing an increasingly dangerous operational environment indeed_ on june six members of the royal military police were killed in al amarah local customs similarly hampered the execution of british standards of justice in the case of nadhem abdullah_ for instance_ the family of the deceased refused to hand over the body for forensic examination significantly reducing the quality of evidence surrounding his death the aitken report also referred to the problems caused to the special investigation branch_ when attempting to investigate serious allegations of abuse_ by the sense of loyalty to fellow soldiers which could lead to lack of cooperation from army personnel and to what the judge in the court martial concerning the killing of the sixth applicant son had described as wall of silence from some of the military witnesses called to give evidence on conclusion of special investigation branch investigation_ the special investigation branch officer would report in writing to the commanding officer of the unit involved such report would include covering letter and summary of the evidence_ together with copies of any documentary evidence relevant to the investigation in the form of statements from witnesses and investigators the report would not contain any decision as to the facts or conclusions as to what had happened it was then for the commanding officer to decide whether or not to refer the case to the army prosecuting authority for possible trial by court martial the aitken report_ dated january see paragraph below commented on the prosecution of armed forces personnel in connection with the death of iraqi civilians_ as follows four cases involving iraqi deaths as result of deliberate abuse have been investigated_ and subsequently referred to the army prosecuting authority apa on the basis there was prima facie case that the victims had been killed unlawfully by british troops the apa preferred charges on three of these cases on the basis that it considered there was realistic prospect of conviction_ and that trial was in the public and service interest and yet not one conviction for murder or manslaughter has been recorded the army position is straightforward on the issue of prosecution legal advice is available for commanding officers and higher authorities to assist with decisions on referring appropriate cases to the apa the director army legal services dals who is responsible to the adjutant general for the provision of legal services to the army_ is additionally appointed by the queen as the apa in that capacity_ he has responsibility for decisions on whether to direct trial for all cases referred by the military chain of command_ and for the prosecution of all cases tried before courts martial_ the standing civilian court and the summary appeal court and for appeals before the courts martial appeal court and the house of lords dals delegates these functions to als army legal services officers appointed as prosecutors in the apa_ and brigadier prosecutions has day to day responsibility for the apa the apa is under the general superintendence of the attorney general and is_ rightly_ independent of the army chain of command the apa alone decides whether to direct court martial trial and the appropriate charges_ and neither the army chain of command_ nor ministers_ officials nor anyone else can make those decisions however complex the situation in which it finds itself_ the army must operate within the law at all times once the apa has made its decision based on the evidence and the law the army has to accept that the consequences of prosecuting particular individuals or of particular charges may have negative impact on its reputation the absence of single conviction for murder or manslaughter as result of deliberate abuse in iraq may appear worrying_ but it is explicable evidence has to be gathered and_ as already mentioned_ this was not an easy process that evidence has to be presented in court and defendants are presumed innocent unless the prosecution can prove its case beyond reasonable doubt that is stiff test no different to the one that applies in our civilian courts in the broader context_ the outcome from prosecutions brought to court martial by the apa is almost exactly comparable with the equivalent civilian courts for example_ as at the end of the conviction rates after trial in the court martial system stood at as compared with in the crown courts it is inevitable that some prosecutions will fail but this does not mean that they should not have been brought in the first place it is the courts_ after all_ that determine guilt_ not the prosecutors indeed_ the fact that only small number of all the odd cases investigated by service police in iraq resulted in prosecution could be interpreted as both positive and negative indicator positive_ in that the evidence and the context did not support the preferring of criminal charges but negative_ in that we know that the service police were hugely hampered_ in some cases_ in their ability to collect evidence of high enough standard for charges to be preferred or for cases to be successfully prosecuted it is important to note that none of this implies any fundamental flaws in the effectiveness of the key elements of the military criminal justice system both the special investigation branch of the royal military police rmp sib and the apa were independently inspected during the police inspection reported that her majesty inspectorate of constabulary assess the rmp sib as having the capability and capacity to run competent level serious criminal reactive investigation and the inspection of the apa in february and march by her majesty crown prosecution service inspectorate concluded that the apa undertakes its in thorough and professional manner_ often in difficult circumstances adding that of decisions to proceed to trial were correct on evidential grounds_ and of decisions to proceed to trial were properly based on public or service interest grounds the deaths of the applicants relatives the following accounts are based on the witness statements of the applicants and the british soldiers involved in each incident these statements were also submitted to the domestic courts and_ as regards all but the fifth applicant_ summarised in their judgments particularly the judgment of the divisional court the first applicant the first applicant is the brother of hazim jum aa gatteh al

gathering at house in al majidiyah for funeral ceremony in iraq it is customary for guns to be discharged at funeral the first applicant stated that he was engaged in receiving guests at the house_ as they arrived for the ceremony_ and saw his brother fired upon by british soldiers as he was walking along the street towards the house according to the first applicant_ his brother was unarmed and only about ten metres away from the soldiers when he was shot and killed another man with him was also killed he had no idea why the soldiers opened fire according to the british account of the incident_ the patrol_ approaching on foot and on very dark night_ heard heavy gunfire from number of different points in al majidiyah as the patrol got deeper into the village they came upon two iraqi men in the street one was about five metres from sergeant who was leading the patrol sergeant saw that he was armed and pointing the gun in his direction in the dark_ it was impossible to tell the position of the second man believing that his life and those of the other soldiers in the patrol were at immediate risk_ sergeant opened fire on the two men without giving any verbal warning the following day_ sergeant produced written statement describing the incident this was passed to the commanding officer of his battalion_ colonel who took the view that the incident fell within the rules of engagement and duly wrote report to that effect colonel sent the report to the brigade_ where it was considered by brigadier moore brigadier moore queried whether the other man had been pointing his gun at the patrol colonel wrote further report that dealt with this query to brigadier moore satisfaction the original report was not retained in the brigade records having considered colonel further report_ as did his deputy chief of staff and his legal adviser_ brigadier moore was satisfied that the actions of sergeant fell within the rules of engagement and so he did not order any further investigation on and august colonel met with members of the dead men tribe he explained why sergeant had opened fire and gave the tribe charitable donation of united states dollars usd from the british army goodwill payment committee_ together with letter explaining the circumstances of the deaths and acknowledging that the deceased had not intended to attack anyone the second applicant the second applicant is the widow of muhammad salim_ who was shot and fatally wounded by sergeant shortly after midnight on november the second applicant was not present when her husband was shot and her evidence was based on what she was told by those who were present she stated that on november during ramadan_ muhammad salim went to visit his brother in law at his home in basra at about british soldiers raided the house they broke down the front door one of the british soldiers came face to face with the second applicant husband in the hall of the house and fired shot at him_ hitting him in the stomach the british soldiers took him to the czech military hospital_ where he died on november according to the british account of the incident_ the patrol had received information from an acquaintance of one of their interpreters that group of men armed with long barrelled weapons_ grenades and rocket propelled grenades had been seen entering the house the order was given for quick search and arrest operation after the patrol failed to gain entry by knocking_ the door was broken down sergeant entered the house through the front door with two other soldiers and cleared the first room as he entered the second room_ he heard automatic gunfire from within the house when sergeant moved forward into the next room by the bottom of the stairs_ two men armed with long barrelled weapons rushed down the stairs towards him there was no time to give verbal warning sergeant believed that his life was in immediate danger he fired one shot at the leading man_ the second applicant husband_ and hit him in the stomach he then trained his weapon on the second man who dropped his gun the applicant family subsequently informed the patrol that they were lawyers and were in dispute with another family of lawyers over the ownership of office premises_ which had led to their being subjected to two armed attacks which they had reported to the police_ one three days before and one only thirty minutes before the patrol forced entry on november the company commander produced report of the incident he concluded that the patrol had deliberately been provided with false intelligence by the other side in the feud having considered the report and spoken to the company commander_ colonel came to the conclusion that the incident fell within the rules of engagement and did not require any further special investigation branch investigation he therefore produced report to that effect the same day and forwarded it to the brigade_ where it was considered by brigadier general jones brigadier jones discussed the matter with his deputy chief of staff and his legal adviser he also discussed the case with his political adviser as result_ brigadier jones also concluded that it was straightforward case that fell within the rules of engagement and duly issued report to that effect the applicant_ who had three young children and an elderly mother in law to support_ received usd from the british army goodwill payment committee_ together with letter setting out the circumstances of the killing the third applicant the third applicant is the widower of hannan mahaibas sadde

family according to the third applicant witness statement_ at about on the evening in question_ he and his family were sitting round the dinner table when there was sudden burst of machine gunfire from outside the building bullets struck his wife in the head and ankles and one of his children on the arm the applicant wife and child were taken to hospital_ where his child recovered but his wife died according to the british account of the incident_ the third applicant wife was shot during firefight between british patrol and number of unknown gunmen when the area was illuminated by parachute flares_ at least three men with long barrelled weapons were seen in open ground_ two of whom were firing directly at the british soldiers one of the gunmen was shot dead during this exchange of fire with the patrol after about seven to ten minutes_ the firing ceased and armed people were seen running away woman the third applicant wife with head injury and child with an arm injury were found when the buildings were searched both were taken to hospital the following morning_ the company commander produced report concerning the incident_ together with statements from the soldiers involved after he had considered the report and statements_ colonel came to the conclusion that the incident fell within the rules of engagement and did not require any further special investigation branch investigation he duly produced report to that effect_ which he then forwarded to the brigade the report was considered by brigadier jones_ who also discussed the matter with his deputy chief of staff_ his legal adviser and colonel as result_ brigadier jones came to the conclusion that the incident fell within the rules of engagement and required no further investigation the fourth applicant the fourth applicant is the brother of waleed fayay muzban_ aged who was shot and fatally injured on the night of august by lance corporal in the al maqaal area of basra the fourth applicant was not present when his brother was shot_ but he claims that the incident was witnessed by his neighbours in his witness statement he stated that his understanding was that his brother was returning home from work at about on the evening in question he was driving minibus along street called souq hitteen_ near where he and the fourth applicant lived for no apparent reason_ according to the applicant statement_ the minibus came under barrage of bullets as result of which waleed was mortally wounded in the chest and stomach lance corporal was member of patrol carrying out check around the perimeter of coalition military base fort apache where three royal military police officers had been killed by gunfire from vehicle the previous day according to the british soldier account of the incident_ lance corporal became suspicious of minibus_ with curtains over its windows_ that was being driven towards the patrol at slow speed with its headlights dipped when the vehicle was signalled to stop_ it appeared to be trying to evade the soldiers so lance corporal pointed his weapon at the driver and ordered him to stop the vehicle then stopped and lance corporal approached the driver door and greeted the driver the fourth applicant brother the driver reacted in an aggressive manner and appeared to be shouting over his shoulder to people in the curtained off area in the back of the vehicle when lance corporal tried to look into the back of the vehicle_ the driver pushed him away by punching him in the chest the driver then shouted into the back of the vehicle and made grab for lance corporal weapon lance corporal had to use force to pull himself free the driver then accelerated away_ swerving in the direction of various other members of the patrol as he did so lance corporal fired at the vehicle tyres and it came to halt about metres from the patrol the driver turned and again shouted into the rear of the vehicle he appeared to be reaching for weapon lance corporal believed that his team was about to be fired on by the driver and others in the vehicle he therefore fired about five aimed shots as the vehicle sped off_ lance corporal fired another two shots at the rear of the vehicle after short interval_ the vehicle screeched to halt the driver got out and shouted at the british soldiers he was ordered to lie on the ground the patrol then approached the vehicle to check for other armed men the vehicle proved to be empty the driver was found to have three bullet wounds in his back and hip he was given first aid and then taken to the czech military hospital where he died later that day or the following day the special investigation branch commenced an investigation on august the investigators recovered fragments of bullets_ empty bullet cases and took digital photographs of the scene the vehicle was recovered and transported to the united kingdom the deceased body had been returned to the family for burial and no post mortem had been carried out_ so the special investigation branch took statements from the two iraqi surgeons who had operated on him meeting was arranged with the family to seek their consent for an exhumation and post mortem_ but this was delayed nine military witnesses involved in the incident were interviewed and had statements taken and further four individuals were interviewed but found to have no evidence to offer lance corporal was not_ however_ questioned since he was suspected by the special investigation branch of having acted contrary to the rules of engagement_ it was special investigation branch practice not to interview him until there was enough evidence to charge him forensic examination was carried out at the scene on september on august colonel sent his initial report concerning the incident to brigadier moore in it he stated that he was satisfied that lance corporal believed that he was acting lawfully within the rules of engagement however_ colonel went on to express the view that it was complex case that would benefit from special investigation branch investigation after brigadier moore had considered colonel report_ discussed the matter with his deputy chief of staff and taken legal advice_ it was decided that the matter could be resolved with unit level investigation_ subject to number of queries being satisfactorily answered as result_ colonel produced further report dated september in which he dealt with the various queries and concluded that special investigation branch investigation was no longer required after discussing the matter again with his deputy chief of staff and having taken further legal advice_ brigadier moore concluded that the case fell within the rules of engagement by this stage_ brigadier moore had been informed that the special investigation branch had commenced an investigation into the incident on september colonel wrote to the special investigation branch asking them to terminate the investigation the same request was made by brigadier moore through his chief of staff during meeting with the senior investigating officer from the special investigation branch the special investigation branch investigation was terminated on september the deceased family received usd from the british army goodwill payment committee and further usd in compensation for the minibus following the fourth applicant application for judicial review see paragraph below the case was reviewed by senior investigation officers in the special investigation branch and the decision was taken to reopen the investigation the investigation was reopened on june and completed on december despite difficulties caused by the very dangerous conditions in iraq at that time on completing the investigation_ the special investigation branch reported to the soldier commanding officer_ who referred the case to the army prosecuting authority in february the army prosecuting authority decided that formal preliminary examination of the witnesses should be held_ in order to clarify any uncertainties and ambiguities in the evidence depositions were taken by the army prosecuting authority from the soldiers who had witnessed the shooting_ and who were the only known witnesses advice was obtained from an independent senior counsel_ who advised that there was no realistic prospect of conviction_ since there was no realistic prospect of establishing that lance corporal had not fired in self defence the file was sent to the attorney general_ who decided not to exercise his jurisdiction to order criminal prosecution the fifth applicant the fifth applicant is the father of ahmed jabbar kareem ali_ who died on may aged according to the statements made by the fifth applicant for the purpose of united kingdom court proceedings_ on may his son did not return home at as expected the fifth applicant went to look for him at al saad square_ where he was told that british soldiers had arrested some iraqi youths earlier in the day the applicant continued to search for his son and was contacted the following morning by another young iraqi_ who told the applicant that he_ the applicant son and two others had been arrested by british soldiers the previous day_ beaten up and forced into the waters of the shatt al arab later_ on may the applicant brother informed the british police about the incident and was requested to surrender ahmed identity card having spent several days waiting and searching_ the applicant found his son body in the water on may the applicant immediately took his son body to the british police station where he was told to take the body to the local hospital the iraqi doctor on duty told the applicant that he was not qualified to carry out post mortem and that there were no pathologists available the applicant decided to bury his son_ since in accordance with islamic practice burial should take place within twenty four hours of death about ten to fifteen days after his son funeral_ the applicant returned to the british police station to ask for an investigation_ but he was informed that it was not the business of the british police to deal with such matters he returned to the police station some days later_ and was informed that the royal military police wished to contact him and that he should go to the presidential palace the following day_ the applicant met with special investigation branch officers at the presidential palace and was informed that an investigation would be commenced the special investigation branch interviewed and took statement from him they took statements from the applicant and other family members at least month after the incident_ the investigators went to al saad square and retrieved clothing belonging to the applicant son and to the other young men who had been arrested at the same time at the end of the forty day mourning period_ the applicant consented to his son body being exhumed for post mortem examination_ but it was not possible at that point to establish either whether ahmed had been beaten prior to death or what had been the cause of death the applicant contends that he was never given an explanation as to the post mortem findings and that he was not kept fully informed of the progress of the investigation in general_ since many of the documents he was given were in english or had been badly translated into arabic the applicant claims that eighteen months elapsed after the exhumation of his son body during which time he had no contact with the investigators in august he was informed that four soldiers had been charged with manslaughter and that trial would take place in england the court martial was held between september and may by that time_ three of the seven soldiers who had been accused of his homicide had left the army_ and further two were absent without leave it was the prosecution case that the soldiers had assisted iraqi police officers to arrest the four youths on suspicion of looting and that they had driven them to the river and forced them in at gunpoint to teach them lesson the applicant and gave evidence to the court martial in april the applicant found the trial process confusing and intimidating and he was left with the impression that the court was biased in favour of the accused gave evidence that the applicant son had appeared to be in distress in the water_ but that the soldiers had driven away without helping him however_ he was not able to identify the defendants as the soldiers involved the defendants denied any responsibility for the death and were acquitted because evidence was found to be inconsistent and unreliable the applicant son case was one of the six cases investigated in the aitken report see paragraph below under the heading learning lessons from discipline cases the report stated we know that two initial police reports were produced in may relating to allegations that_ on two separate occasions but within the space of just over fortnight_ iraqis had drowned in the shat al arab at the hands of british soldiers that one of those cases did not subsequently proceed to trial is irrelevant at the time_ an ostensibly unusual event was alleged to have occurred twice in short space of time with all their other duties_ the commanders on the ground cannot reasonably be blamed for failing to identify what may or may not have been trend but more immediate_ effective system for referring that sort of information to others with the capacity to analyse it might have identified such trend in fact_ the evidence suggests that these were two isolated incidents but had they been symptom of more fundamental failing_ they might have been overlooked by comparison_ if there had been two reports of new weapon being used by insurgents to attack british armoured vehicles within fortnight_ it is certain that the lessons learned process would have identified its significance_ determined the counter measures needed to combat it_ and quickly disseminated new procedures to mitigate the risk the fact that this process does not apply to disciplinary matters is only partly explained by the need for confidentiality and the preservation of evidence but it is failure in the process that could be fairly easily rectified without compromising the fundamental principle of innocence until proven guilty the report continued_ under the heading delay the amount of time taken to resolve some of the cases with which this report is concerned has been unacceptable the court martial in connection with the death of ahmed jabbar kareem did not convene until september twenty eight months after he died by that time_ three of the seven soldiers who had been accused of his murder had left the army_ and further two were absent without leave in most cases_ it is inappropriate for the army to take administrative action against any officer or soldier until the disciplinary process has been completed_ because of the risk of prejudicing the trial when that disciplinary process takes as long as it has taken in most of these cases_ then the impact of any subsequent administrative sanctions is significantly reduced indeed_ such sanctions are likely to be moreover_ the longer the disciplinary process takes_ the less likely it is that the chain of command will take proactive measures to rectify the matters that contributed to the commission of the crimes in the first place the fifth applicant brought civil proceedings against the ministry of defence for damages in respect of his son death the claim was settled without going to hearing_ by the payment of pounds sterling gbp on december in addition_ on february major general cubbitt wrote to the fifth applicant and formally apologised on behalf of the british army for its role in his son death the sixth applicant the sixth applicant is colonel in the basra police force his son_ baha mousa_ was aged when he died while in the custody of the british army_ three days after having been arrested by soldiers on september according to the sixth applicant_ on the night of to september his son had been working as receptionist at the ibn al haitham hotel in basra early in the morning of september_ the applicant went to the hotel to pick his son up from work on his arrival he noticed that british unit had surrounded the hotel the applicant son and six other hotel employees were lying on the floor of the hotel lobby with their hands behind their heads the applicant expressed his concern to the lieutenant in charge of the operation_ who reassured him that it was routine investigation that would be over in couple of hours on the third day after his son had been detained_ the sixth applicant was visited by royal military police unit he was told that his son had been killed in custody at british military base in basra he was asked to identify the corpse the applicant son body and face were covered in blood and bruises his nose was broken and part of the skin of his face had been torn away one of the other hotel employees who was arrested on september stated in witness statement prepared for the united kingdom domestic court proceedings that_ once the prisoners had arrived at the base_ the iraqi detainees were hooded_ forced to maintain stress positions_ denied food and water and kicked and beaten during the detention_ baha mousa was taken into another room_ where he could be heard screaming and moaning late on september brigadier moore_ who had taken part in the operation in which the hotel employees had been arrested_ was informed that baha mousa was dead and that other detainees had been ill treated the special investigation branch was immediately called in to investigate the death since local hospitals were on strike_ pathologist was flown in from the united kingdom baha mousa was found to have ninety three identifiable injuries on his body and to have died of asphyxiation eight other iraqis had also been inhumanely treated_ with two requiring hospital treatment the investigation was concluded in early april and the report distributed to the unit chain of command on december the divisional court held that the inquiry into the applicant son death had not been effective see paragraph below on december the court of appeal decided to remit the question to the divisional court since there had been further developments see paragraph below on july seven british soldiers were charged with criminal offences in connection with baha mousa death on september at the start of the court martial_ one of the soldiers pleaded guilty to the war crime of inhumane treatment but not guilty to manslaughter on february charges were dropped against four of the seven soldiers and on march the other two soldiers were acquitted on april the soldier convicted of inhumane treatment was sentenced to one year imprisonment and dismissal from the army on january the ministry of defence published report written by brigadier robert aitken concerning six cases of alleged deliberate abuse and killing of iraqi civilians_ including the deaths of the fifth and sixth applicants sons the aitken report the applicant brought civil proceedings against the ministry of defence_ which concluded in july by the formal and public acknowledgement of liability and the payment of gbp in compensation in written statement given in parliament on may the secretary of state for defence announced that there would be public inquiry into the death of baha mousa the inquiry is chaired by retired court of appeal judge_ with the following terms of reference to investigate and report on the circumstances surrounding the death of baha mousa and the treatment of those detained with him_ taking account of the investigations which have already taken place_ in particular where responsibility lay for approving the practice of conditioning detainees by any members of the st battalion_ the queen lancashire regiment in iraq in and to make recommendations at the time of adoption of the present judgment_ the inquiry had concluded the oral hearings but had not yet delivered its report the domestic proceedings under the human rights act the divisional court on march the secretary of state for defence decided_ in connection with the deaths of thirteen iraqi civilians including the relatives of the six applicants_ not to conduct independent inquiries into the deaths not to accept liability for the deaths and not to pay just satisfaction the thirteen claimants applied for judicial review of these decisions_ seeking declarations that both the procedural and the substantive obligations of article and_ in the case of the sixth applicant_ article of the convention had been violated as result of the deaths and the secretary of state refusal to order any investigation on may judge of the divisional court directed that six test cases would proceed to hearing including the cases of the first_ second_ third_ fourth and sixth applicants and that the other seven cases including that of the fifth applicant would be stayed pending the resolution of the preliminary issues on december the divisional court rejected the claims of the first four applicants but accepted the claim of the sixth applicant ewhc admin having reviewed this court case law_ in particular banković and others belgium and others dec gc no echr xii it held that_ essentially_ jurisdiction under article of the convention was territorial_ although there were exceptions one exception applied where state party had effective control of an area outside its own territory this basis of jurisdiction applied only where the territory of one contracting state was controlled by another contracting state_ since the convention operated essentially within its own regional sphere and permitted no vacuum within that space this basis of jurisdiction could not_ therefore_ apply in iraq there was an additional exception_ which arose from the exercise of authority by contracting state agents anywhere in the world_ but this was limited to specific cases recognised by international law and identified piecemeal in the court case law no general rationale in respect of this group of exceptions was discernable from the court case law however_ the instances recognised so far arose out of the exercise of state authority in or from location which had discrete quasi territorial quality_ or where the state agent presence in the foreign state was consented to by that state and protected by international law_ such as embassies_ consulates_ vessels and aircraft registered in the respondent state british military prison_ operating in iraq with the consent of the iraqi sovereign authorities and containing arrested suspects_ could be covered by this narrow exception it was arguable that öcalan turkey no march also fell into this category_ since the applicant was arrested in turkish aircraft and taken immediately to turkey however_ the divisional court did not consider that the chamber judgment in öcalan should be treated as illuminating since turkey had not raised any objection based on lack of jurisdiction at the admissibility stage it followed that the deaths as result of military operations in the field_ such as those complained of by the first four applicants_ did not fall within the united kingdom jurisdiction under article of the convention_ but that the death of the sixth applicant son_ in british military prison_ did the divisional court further held that the scope of the human rights act was identical to that of the convention for these purposes the divisional court found that there had been breach of the investigative duty under articles and of the convention in respect of the sixth applicant son since_ by july some ten months after the killing_ the results of the investigation were unknown and inconclusive the judge commented that although there has been evidence of rather general nature about the difficulties of conducting investigations in iraq at that time about basic security problems involved in going to iraqi homes to interview people_ about lack of interpreters_ cultural differences_ logistic problems_ lack of records_ and so forth without any further understanding of the outcome of the special investigation branch report_ it is impossible to understand what_ if any_ relevance any of this has to death which occurred not in the highways or byways of iraq_ but in military prison under the control of british forces although captain logan says that identity parades were logistically very difficult_ detainees were moved to different location_ and some military witnesses had returned to the uk_ she also says that these problems only delayed the process but did not prevent it taking place satisfactorily there is nothing else before us to explain the dilatoriness of the investigative process which might possibly be compared with the progress_ and open public scrutiny_ which we have noted seems to have been achieved with other investigations arising out of possible offences in prisons under the control of us forces as for the special investigation branch report itself_ on the evidence before us that would not contain any decision as to the facts or any conclusions as to what has or might have happened in these circumstances we cannot accept counsel for the government submission that the investigation has been adequate in terms of the procedural obligation arising out of article of the convention even if an investigation solely in the hands of the special investigation branch might be said to be independent_ on the grounds that the special investigation branch are hierarchically and practically independent of the military units under investigation_ as to which we have doubts in part because the report of the special investigation branch is to the unit chain of command itself_ it is difficult to say that the investigation which has occurred has been timely_ open or effective in respect of the other five deaths_ the judge considered that_ if he were wrong on the jurisdiction issue and the claims did fall within the scope of the convention_ the investigative duty under article had not been met_ for the following reasons in all these cases_ as in the case of mr mousa_ the united kingdom authorities were proceeding on the basis that the convention did not apply thus the immediate investigations were in each case conducted_ as matter of policy_ by the unit involved only in case that concerning mr waleed muzban_ was there any involvement of the special investigation branch and that was stood down_ at any rate before being reopened at some uncertain time upon review of the file back in the uk the investigations were therefore not independent nor were they effective_ for they essentially consisted only in comparatively superficial exercise_ based on the evidence of the soldiers involved themselves_ and even then on paucity of interviews or witness statements_ an exercise which was one sided and omitted the assistance of forensic evidence such as might have become available from ballistic or medical expertise in connection with these cases_ counsel for the government main submission was that_ in extremely difficult situations_ both in operational terms in the field and in terms of post event investigations_ the army and the authorities had done their best he particularly emphasised the following aspects of the evidence there was no rule of law in iraq at the start of the occupation there was no police force at all_ and at best the force was totally inadequate_ as well as being under constant attack although the iraqi courts were functioning_ they were subject to intimidation there was no local civil inquest system or capability the local communications systems were not functioning there were no mortuaries_ no post mortem system_ no reliable pathologists the security situation was the worst ever experienced by seasoned soldiers there was daily fighting between tribal and criminal gangs the number of troops available were small and cultural differences exacerbated all these difficulties we would not discount these difficulties_ which cumulatively must have amounted to grave impediments for anyone concerned to conduct investigations as they might have liked to have carried them out however_ irrespective of counsel for the applicants submission_ in reliance on the turkish cases_ that security problems provide no excuse for failure in the article investigative duty_ we would conclude that_ on the hypothesis stated_ the investigations would still not pass muster they were not independent they were one sided and the commanders concerned were not trying to do their best according to the dictates of article that is not to say_ however_ that_ in other circumstances_ we would ignore the strategic difficulties of the situation the turkish cases are all concerned with deaths within the state party own territory in that context_ the court was entitled to be highly sceptical about the state own professions of difficulties in an investigative path which it in any event may hardly have chosen to follow it seems to us that this scepticism cannot be so easily transplanted in the setting the court of appeal the first four applicants appealed against the divisional court finding that their relatives did not fall within the united kingdom jurisdiction the secretary of state also cross appealed against the finding in relation to the sixth applicant son although he accepted before the court of appeal that an iraqi in the actual custody of british soldiers in military detention centre in iraq was within the united kingdom jurisdiction under article of the convention_ he contended that the human rights act had no effect and that the sixth applicant claim was not_ therefore_ enforceable in the national courts on december the court of appeal dismissed the appeals and the cross appeal ewca civ having reviewed the court case law on jurisdiction under article of the convention_ brooke lj_ who gave the leading judgment_ held that state could exercise jurisdiction when it applied control and authority over complainant which he termed state agent authority abbreviated to saa and when it held effective control of an area outside its borders effective control of an area or eca observing as follows would therefore be more cautious than the divisional court in my approach to the banković and others judgment it seems to me that it left open both the eca and saa approaches to jurisdiction_ while at the same time emphasising in paragraph that because an saa approach might constitute violation of another state sovereignty for example_ when someone is kidnapped by the agents of state on the territory of another state without that state invitation or consent this route to any recognition that jurisdiction has been exercised within the meaning of an international treaty should be approached with caution he considered_ inter alia_ the cases of öcalan turkey gc no echr iv freda italy dec no commission decision of october decisions and reports dr and sánchez ramirez france dec no commission decision of june dr a_ and observed that these cases had nothing to do with the principle of public international law relating to activities within aircraft registered with state flying over the territory of another state instead_ the findings of jurisdiction in these cases were examples of the state agent authority doctrine applying when someone was within the control and authority of agents of contracting state_ even outside the espace juridique of the council of europe_ and whether or not the host state consented to the exercise of control and authority on its soil applying the relevant principles to the facts of the case_ he concluded that the sixth applicant son came within the control and authority of the united kingdom_ and therefore its jurisdiction_ from the time he was arrested at the hotel the relatives of the other claimants had not been under the control and authority of british troops at the time when they were killed_ and were not therefore within the united kingdom jurisdiction he concluded in this connection that it is essential_ in my judgment_ to set rules which are readily intelligible if troops deliberately and effectively restrict someone liberty he is under their control this did not happen in any of these five cases he then examined whether_ on the facts_ it could be said that british troops were in effective control of basra city during the period in question_ such as to fix the united kingdom with jurisdiction under the effective control of an area doctrine on this point_ brooke lj concluded as follows basra city was in the coalition provisional authority regional area called cpa south during the period of military occupation there was significant degree of british responsibility and authority in cpa south_ although its staff were drawn from five different countries and until the end of july the regional coordinator was dane indeed_ only one of the four governorate teams in cpa south was headed by british coordinator however_ although the chain of command for the british military presence in iraq led ultimately to us general_ the al basra and maysan provinces were an area of direct british military responsibility as have already said the secretary of state accepts that the uk was an occupying power within the meaning of article of the hague regulations at least in those areas of southern iraq_ and particularly basra city_ where british troops exercised sufficient authority for this purpose but whatever may have been the position under the hague regulations_ the question this court has to address is whether british troops were in effective control of basra city for eca purposes the situation in august to november contrasts starkly with the situations in northern cyprus and in the russian occupied part of moldova which feature in strasbourg case law in each of those cases part of the territory of contracting state was occupied by another contracting state which had every intention of exercising its control on long term basis the civilian administration of those territories was under the control of the occupying state_ and it deployed sufficient troops to ensure that its control of the area was effective the statement of brigadier moore_ whose command included the british forces in the basra area between may and november tells very different story he was not provided with nearly enough troops and other resources to enable his brigade to exercise effective control of basra city described how the local police would not uphold the law if british troops arrested somebody and gave them to the iraqi police_ the police would hand them over to the judiciary_ who were themselves intimidated by the local tribes_ and the suspected criminals were back on the streets within day or two this state of affairs gave the british no confidence in the local criminal justice system it also diluted their credibility with local people although british troops arranged local protection for the judges_ this made little difference the prisons_ for their part_ were barely functioning after describing other aspects of the highly volatile situation in which relatively small number of british military personnel were trying to police large city as best they could_ brig adier moore said the combination of terrorist activity_ the volatile situation and the ineffectiveness of iraqi security forces meant that the security situation remained on knife edge for much of our tour despite our high work rate and best efforts_ felt that at the end of august we were standing on the edge of an abyss it was only when subsequent reinforcements arrived and we started to receive intelligence from some of the islamic parties that started to regain the initiative unlike the turkish army in northern cyprus_ the british military forces had no control over the civil administration of iraq in my judgment it is quite impossible to hold that the uk_ although an occupying power for the purposes of the hague regulations and the geneva iv convention was in effective control of basra city for the purposes of the european court jurisprudence at the material time if it had been_ it would have been obliged_ pursuant to the banković and others judgment_ to secure to everyone in basra city the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the convention one only has to state that proposition to see how utterly unreal it is the uk possessed no executive_ legislative or judicial authority in basra city_ other than the limited authority given to its military forces_ and as an occupying power it was bound to respect the laws in force in iraq unless absolutely prevented see article of the hague regulations it could not be equated with civil power it was simply there to maintain security_ and to support the civil administration in iraq in number of different ways sedley lj observed_ in connection with this issue on the one hand_ it sits ill in the mouth of state which has helped to displace and dismantle by force another nation civil authority to plead that_ as an occupying power_ it has so little control that it cannot be responsible for securing the population basic rights however_ the fact is that it cannot the invasion brought in its wake vacuum of civil authority which british forces were and still are unable to fill on the evidence before the court they were_ at least between mid and mid holding fragile line against anarchy the court of appeal unanimously concluded that_ save for the death of the sixth applicant son_ which fell within the state agent authority exception_ the united kingdom did not have jurisdiction under article of the convention it decided that the sixth applicant claim also fell within the scope of the human rights act since the divisional court examination of the case_ additional information had emerged about the investigation into the death of the sixth applicant son_ including that court martial proceedings were pending against number of soldiers the court of appeal therefore remitted the question whether there had been an adequate investigation to the divisional court for reconsideration following the completion of the court martial proceedings despite his conclusion on jurisdiction_ brooke lj_ at the express invitation of the government_ commented on the adequacy of the investigations carried out into the deaths_ as follows after all_ the first two articles of the convention merely articulate the contemporary concern of the entire european community about the importance that must always be attached to every human life needless to say_ the obligation to comply with these well established international human rights standards would require_ among other things_ far greater investment in the resources available to the royal military police than was available to them in iraq_ and complete severance of their investigations from the military chain of command in other words_ if international standards are to be observed_ the task of investigating incidents in which human life is taken by british forces must be completely taken away from the military chain of command and vested in the royal military police it contains the requisite independence so long as it is free to decide for itself when to start and when to cease an investigation_ and so long as it reports in the first instance to the army prosecuting authority and not to the military chain of command it must then conduct an effective investigation_ and it will be helped in this regard by the passages from the european court case law have quoted many of the deficiencies highlighted by the evidence in this case will be remedied if the royal military police perform this role_ and if they are also properly trained and properly resourced to conduct their investigations with the requisite degree of thoroughness the house of lords the first four applicants appealed and the secretary of state cross appealed to the house of lords_ which gave judgment on june ukhl the majority of the house of lords lord rodger of earlsferry_ baroness hale of richmond_ lord carswell and lord brown of eaton under heywood held that the general purpose of the human rights act was to provide remedial structure in domestic law for the rights guaranteed by the convention_ and that the act should therefore be interpreted as applying wherever the united kingdom had jurisdiction under article of the convention lord bingham of cornhill_ dissenting_ held that the human rights act had no application in relation to the first four applicants complaints_ the majority of the house of lords found that the united kingdom did not have jurisdiction over the deaths because of his opinion that the human rights act had no application_ lord bingham did not consider it useful to express view as to whether the united kingdom exercised jurisdiction within the meaning of article of the convention lord brown_ with whom the majority agreed_ began by observing that ultimately the decision about how article of the convention should be interpreted and applied was for the european court of human rights_ since the duty of the national court was only to keep pace with the court case law there was danger in national court construing the convention too generously in favour of an applicant_ since the respondent state had no means of referring such case to the court lord brown took as his starting point the decision of the grand chamber in banković and others cited above which he described as watershed authority in the light of which the strasbourg jurisprudence as whole has to be re evaluated he considered that the following propositions could be derived from the decision in banković and others paragraph of the house of lords judgment article reflects an essentially territorial notion of jurisdiction phrase repeated several times in the court judgment other bases of jurisdiction being exceptional and requiring special justification in the particular circumstances of each case the convention operates_ subject to article in an essentially regional context and notably in the legal space espace juridique of the contracting states within the area of the council of europe countries the court recognises article jurisdiction to avoid vacuum in human rights protection when the territory would normally be covered by the convention in council of europe country where otherwise as in northern cyprus the inhabitants would have found themselves excluded from the benefits of the convention safeguards and system which they had previously enjoyed the rights and freedoms defined in the convention cannot be divided and tailored the circumstances in which the court has exceptionally recognised the exercise of jurisdiction by state include where the state through the effective control of the relevant territory and its inhabitants abroad as consequence of military occupation or through the consent_ invitation or acquiescence of the government of that territory_ exercises all or some of the public powers normally to be exercised by the government of that territory when otherwise there would be vacuum within council of europe country_ the government of that country itself being unable to fulfil the obligations it had undertaken under the convention as in northern cyprus ii ases involving the activities of its diplomatic or consular agents abroad and on board craft and vessels registered in_ or flying the flag of_ that state where customary international law and treaty provisions have recognised the exercise of jurisdiction iii certain other cases where state responsibility could_ in principle_ be engaged because of acts which produced effects or were performed outside their own territory drozd and janousek france and spain june series no ehrr at is the only authority specifically referred to in banković and others as exemplifying this class of exception to the general rule drozd and janousek however_ contemplated no more than that_ if french judge exercised jurisdiction in andorra in his capacity as french judge_ then anyone complaining of violation of his convention rights by that judge would be regarded as being within france jurisdiction iv the soering the united kingdom july series no ehrr line of cases_ the court pointed out_ involves action by the state whilst the person concerned is on its territory_ clearly within its jurisdiction banković and others_ and not_ therefore_ the exercise of the state jurisdiction abroad lord brown referred to the öcalan_ freda and sánchez ramirez line of cases cited above in each of which the applicant was forcibly removed from country outside the council of europe_ with the full cooperation of the foreign authorities_ to stand trial in the respondent state he observed that this line of cases concerning irregular extraditions constituted one category of exceptional cases expressly contemplated by banković and others cited above as having special justification for jurisdiction under article of the convention he did not consider that the first four applicants cases fell into any of the exceptions to the territorial principle so far recognised by the court lord brown next considered the court judgment in issa and others turkey no november on which the applicants relied_ and held as follows if and in so far as issa and others is said to support the altogether wider notions of article jurisdiction contended for by the appellants on this appeal_ cannot accept it in the first place_ the statements relied upon must be regarded as obiter dicta secondly_ as just explained_ such wider assertions of jurisdiction are not supported by the authorities cited at any rate_ those authorities accepted as relevant by the grand chamber in banković and others thirdly_ such wider view of jurisdiction would clearly be inconsistent both with the reasoning in banković and others and_ indeed_ with its result either it would extend the effective control principle beyond the council of europe area where alone it had previously been applied_ as has been seen_ to northern cyprus_ to the ajarian autonomous republic in georgia and to transdniestria to iraq_ an area like the fry federal republic of yugoslavia considered in banković and others outside the council of europe and_ indeed_ would do so contrary to the inescapable logic of the court case law on article alternatively it would stretch to breaking point the concept of jurisdiction extending to those subject to state authority and control it is one thing to recognise as exceptional the specific narrow categories of cases have sought to summarise above it would be quite another to accept that whenever contracting state acts militarily or otherwise through its agents abroad_ those affected by such activities fall within its article jurisdiction such contention would prove altogether too much it would make nonsense of much that was said in banković and others not least as to the convention being constitutional instrument of european public order operating in an essentially regional context not designed to be applied throughout the world_ even in respect of the conduct of contracting states it would_ indeed_ make redundant the principle of effective control of an area what need for that if jurisdiction arises in any event under general principle of authority and control irrespective of whether the area is effectively controlled or within the council of europe there is one other central objection to the creation of the wide basis of jurisdiction here contended for by the appellants under the rubric control and authority going beyond that arising in any of the narrowly recognised categories already discussed and yet short of that arising from the effective control of territory within the council of europe area banković and others and later assanidze georgia gc no echr ii stands_ as stated_ for the indivisible nature of article jurisdiction it cannot be divided and tailored as banković and others had earlier pointed out at the applicant interpretation of jurisdiction would invert and divide the positive obligation on contracting states to secure the substantive rights in manner never contemplated by article of the convention when_ moreover_ the convention applies_ it operates as living instrument öcalan provides an example of this_ recognition that the interpretation of article has been modified consequent on the territories encompassed by the member states of the council of europe having become zone free of capital punishment paragraphs and of banković and others may note_ contrast on the one hand the convention substantive provisions and the competence of the convention organs to both of which the living instrument approach applies and_ on the other hand_ the scope of article the scope and reach of the entire convention to which it does not bear in mind too the rigour with which the court applies the convention_ well exemplified by the series of cases from the conflict zone of south eastern turkey in which_ the state difficulties no dilution has been permitted of the investigative obligations arising under articles and the point is this except where state really does have effective control of territory_ it cannot hope to secure convention rights within that territory and_ unless it is within the area of the council of europe_ it is unlikely in any event to find certain of the convention rights it is bound to secure reconcilable with the customs of the resident population indeed it goes further than that during the period in question here it is common ground that the uk was an occupying power in southern iraq and bound as such by the geneva iv convention and by the hague regulations article of the hague regulations provides that the occupant shall take all the measures in his power to restore_ and ensure_ as far as possible_ public order and safety_ while respecting_ unless absolutely prevented_ the laws in force in the country the appellants argue that occupation within the meaning of the hague regulations necessarily involves the occupant having effective control of the area and so being responsible for securing there all convention rights and freedoms so far as this being the case_ however_ the occupants obligation is to respect the laws in force not to introduce laws and the means to enforce them for example_ courts and justice system such as to satisfy the requirements of the convention often for example where sharia law is in force convention rights would clearly be incompatible with the laws of the territory occupied lord rodger at paragraph with whom baroness hale agreed_ and lord carswell paragraph expressly held that the united kingdom was not in effective control of basra city and the surrounding area for purposes of jurisdiction under article of the convention at the relevant time the secretary of state accepted that the facts of the sixth applicant case fell within the united kingdom jurisdiction under article of the convention the parties therefore agreed that if as the majority held the jurisdictional scope of the human rights act was the same as that of the convention_ the sixth applicant case should be remitted to the divisional court_ as the court of appeal had ordered in consequence_ it was unnecessary for the house of lords to examine the jurisdictional issue in relation to the death of the sixth applicant son however_ lord brown_ with whom the majority agreed_ concluded as for the sixth case_ for my part would recognise the uk jurisdiction over mr mousa only on the narrow basis found established by the divisional court_ essentially by analogy with the exception made for embassies an analogy recognised too in hess the united kingdom no commission decision of may decisions and reports commission decision in the context of foreign prison which had itself referred to the embassy case of germany_ no commission decision of september yearbook ii relevant international law materialsa international humanitarian law on belligerent occupation the duties of an occupying power can be found primarily in articles to of the regulations concerning the laws and customs of war on land the hague_ october the hague regulations and articles to and to of the geneva convention iv relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war of august the fourth geneva convention as well as in certain provisions of the protocol additional to the geneva conventions of august and relating to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts protocol of june additional protocol articles and of the hague regulations provide as follows article territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army the occupation extends only to the territory where such authority has been established and can be exercised article the authority of the legitimate power having in fact passed into the hands of the occupant_ the latter shall take all the measures in his power to restore_ and ensure_ as far as possible_ public order and safety_ while respecting_ unless absolutely prevented_ the laws in force in the country article of the fourth geneva convention provides that penal laws may be repealed or suspended by the occupying power only where they constitute threat to the security or an obstacle to the application of the fourth geneva convention it also details the situations in which the occupying power is entitled to introduce legislative measures these are specifically provisions which are essential to enable the occupying power to fulfil its obligations under the present convention_ to maintain the orderly government of the territory_ and to ensure the security of the occupying power_ of the members and property of the occupying forces or administration_ and likewise of the establishments and lines of communication used by them agreements concluded between the occupying power and the local authorities cannot deprive the population of the occupied territory of the protection afforded by international humanitarian law and protected persons themselves can in no circumstances renounce their rights fourth geneva convention_ articles and occupation does not create any change in the status of the territory see article of additional protocol which can only be effected by peace treaty or by annexation followed by recognition the former sovereign remains sovereign and there is no change in the nationality of the inhabitants case law of the international court of justice concerning the between international humanitarian law and international human rights law and the obligations of states under international human rights law in the proceedings concerning the international court of justice advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of wall in the occupied palestinian territory july israel denied that the human rights instruments to which it was party_ including the international covenant on civil and political rights_ were applicable to the occupied palestinian territory and asserted at paragraph that humanitarian law is the protection granted in conflict situation such as the one in the west bank and gaza strip_ whereas human rights treaties were intended for the protection of citizens from their own government in times of peace in order to determine whether the instruments were applicable in the occupied palestinian territory_ the international court of justice first addressed the issue of the relationship between international humanitarian law and international human rights law_ holding as follows the court considers that the protection offered by human rights conventions does not cease in case of armed conflict_ save through the effect of provisions for derogation of the kind to be found in article of the international covenant on civil and political rights as regards the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law_ there are thus three possible situations some rights may be exclusively matters of international humanitarian law others may be exclusively matters of human rights law yet others may be matters of both these branches of international law in order to answer the question put to it_ the court will have to take into consideration both these branches of international law_ namely human rights law and_ as lex specialis_ international humanitarian law the international court of justice next considered the question whether the international covenant on civil and political rights was capable of applying outside the state national territory and whether it applied in the occupied palestinian territory it held as follows references and citations omitted the scope of application of the international covenant on civil and political rights is defined by article paragraph thereof_ which provides each state party to the present covenant undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognised in the present covenant_ without distinction of any kind_ such as race_ colour_ sex_ language_ religion_ political or other opinion_ national or social origin_ property_ birth or other status this provision can be interpreted as covering only individuals who are both present within state territory and subject to that state jurisdiction it can also be construed as covering both individuals present within state territory and those outside that territory but subject to that state jurisdiction the court will thus seek to determine the meaning to be given to this text the court would observe that_ while the jurisdiction of states is primarily territorial_ it may sometimes be exercised outside the national territory considering the object and purpose of the international covenant on civil and political rights_ it would seem natural that_ even when such is the case_ states parties to the covenant should be bound to comply with its provisions the constant practice of the human rights committee is consistent with this thus_ the committee has found the covenant applicable where the state exercises its jurisdiction on foreign territory it has ruled on the legality of acts by uruguay in cases of arrests carried out by uruguayan agents in brazil or argentina it decided to the same effect in the case of the confiscation of passport by uruguayan consulate in germany the court takes note in this connection of the position taken by israel_ in relation to the applicability of the covenant_ in its communications to the human rights committee_ and of the view of the committee in israel stated that_ when preparing its report to the committee_ it had had to face the question whether individuals resident in the occupied territories were indeed subject to israel jurisdiction for purposes of the application of the covenant israel took the position that the covenant and similar instruments did not apply directly to the current situation in the occupied territories the committee_ in its concluding observations after examination of the report_ expressed concern at israel attitude and pointed to the long standing presence of israel in the occupied territories_ israel ambiguous attitude towards their future status_ as well as the exercise of effective jurisdiction by israeli security forces therein in in face of israel consistent position_ to the effect that the covenant does not apply beyond its own territory_ notably in the west bank and gaza the committee reached the following conclusion in the current circumstances_ the provisions of the covenant apply to the benefit of the population of the occupied territories_ for all conduct by the state party authorities or agents in those territories that affect the enjoyment of rights enshrined in the covenant and fall within the ambit of state responsibility of israel under the principles of public international law in conclusion_ the court considers that the international covenant on civil and political rights is applicable in respect of acts done by state in the exercise of its jurisdiction outside its own territory in addition_ the international court of justice appeared to assume that_ even in respect of acts_ it would in principle be possible for state to derogate from its obligations under the international covenant on civil and political rights_ article of which provides in time of public emergency which threatens the life of the nation and the existence of which is officially proclaimed_ the states parties to the present covenant may take measures derogating from their obligations under the present covenant to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation_ provided that such measures are not inconsistent with their other obligations under international law and do not involve discrimination solely on the ground of race_ colour_ sex_ language_ religion or social origin thus_ in paragraph of its advisory opinion_ having considered whether the acts in question were justified under international humanitarian law on grounds of military exigency_ the international court of justice held the court would further observe that some human rights conventions_ and in particular the international covenant on civil and political rights_ contain provisions which states parties may invoke in order to derogate_ under various conditions_ from certain of their conventional obligations in this respect_ the court would however recall that the communication notified by israel to the secretary general of the united nations under article of the international covenant on civil and political rights concerns only article of the covenant_ relating to the right to freedom and security of person see paragraph above israel is accordingly bound to respect all the other provisions of that instrument in its judgment armed activities on the territory of the congo democratic republic of the congo drc uganda of december the international court of justice considered whether_ during the relevant period_ uganda was an occupying power of any part of the territory of the democratic republic of the congo_ within the meaning of customary international law_ as reflected in article of the hague regulations of the judgment the international court of justice found that ugandan forces were stationed in the province of ituri and exercised authority there_ in the sense that they had substituted their own authority for that of the congolese government the international court of justice continued the court thus concludes that uganda was the occupying power in ituri at the relevant time as such it was under an obligation_ according to article of the hague regulations of to take all the measures in its power to restore_ and ensure_ as far as possible_ public order and safety in the occupied area_ while respecting_ unless absolutely prevented_ the laws in force in the drc this obligation comprised the duty to secure respect for the applicable rules of international human rights law and international humanitarian law_ to protect the inhabitants of the occupied territory against acts of violence_ and not to tolerate such violence by any third party the court_ having concluded that uganda was an occupying power in ituri at the relevant time_ finds that uganda responsibility is engaged both for any acts of its military that violated its international obligations and for any lack of vigilance in preventing violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by other actors present in the occupied territory_ including rebel groups acting on their own account the court notes that uganda at all times has responsibility for all actions and omissions of its own military forces in the territory of the drc in breach of its obligations under the rules of international human rights law and international humanitarian law which are relevant and applicable in the specific situation the international court of justice established the facts relating to the serious breaches of human rights allegedly attributable to uganda_ in the occupied ituri region and elsewhere in order to determine whether the conduct in question constituted breach of uganda international obligations_ the international court of justice recalled its finding in the above cited legal consequences of the construction of wall in the occupied palestinian territory advisory opinion that both international humanitarian law and international human rights law would have to be taken into consideration and that international human rights instruments were capable of having an application_ particularly in occupied territories the international court of justice next determined which were the applicable rules of international human rights law and international humanitarian law by listing the international humanitarian and international human rights treaties to which both uganda and the democratic republic of the congo were party_ together with the relevant principles of customary international law the duty to investigate alleged violations of the right to life in situations of armed conflict and occupation under international humanitarian law and international human rights law article of the geneva convention iii relative to the treatment of prisoners of war of august the third geneva convention provides that an official enquiry must be held by the detaining power following the suspected homicide of prisoner of war article of the fourth geneva convention provides every death or serious injury of an internee_ caused or suspected to have been caused by sentry_ another internee or any other person_ as well as any death the cause of which is unknown_ shall be immediately followed by an official enquiry by the detaining power communication on this subject shall be sent immediately to the protecting power the evidence of any witnesses shall be taken_ and report including such evidence shall be prepared and forwarded to the said protecting power if the enquiry indicates the guilt of one or more persons_ the detaining power shall take all necessary steps to ensure the prosecution of the person or persons responsible the geneva conventions also place an obligation on each high contracting party to investigate and prosecute alleged grave breaches of the conventions_ including the wilful killing of protected persons articles and of the geneva convention for the amelioration of the condition of the sick and wounded in the field of august the first geneva convention articles and of the geneva convention ii for the amelioration of the condition of wounded_ sick and shipwrecked members of armed forces at sea of august the second geneva convention articles and of the third geneva convention and articles and of the fourth geneva convention in his report of march on extrajudicial_ summary or arbitrary executions cn the united nations special rapporteur_ philip alston_ observed in connection with the right to life under article of the international covenant on civil and political rights in situations of armed conflict and occupation footnotes omitted armed conflict and occupation do not discharge the state duty to investigate and prosecute human rights abuses the right to life is non derogable regardless of circumstance this prohibits any practice of not investigating alleged violations during armed conflict or occupation as the human rights committee has held_ it is inherent in the protection of rights explicitly recognised as non derogable that they must be secured by procedural guarantees the provisions of the international covenant on civil and political rights relating to procedural safeguards may never be made subject to measures that would circumvent the protection of non derogable rights it is undeniable that during armed conflicts circumstances will sometimes impede investigation such circumstances will never discharge the obligation to investigate this would eviscerate the non derogable character of the right to life but they may affect the modalities or particulars of the investigation in addition to being fully responsible for the conduct of their agents_ in relation to the acts of private actors states are also held to standard of due diligence in armed conflicts as well as peace on case by case basis state might utilise less effective measures of investigation in response to concrete constraints for example_ when hostile forces control the scene of shooting_ conducting an autopsy may prove impossible regardless of the circumstances_ however_ investigations must always be conducted as effectively as possible and never be reduced to mere formality in its judgment in the case of the mapiripán massacre colombia of september the inter american court of human rights held_ inter alia_ in connection with the respondent state failure fully to investigate the massacre of civilians carried out by paramilitary group with the alleged assistance of the state authorities in this regard_ the court recognises the difficult circumstances of colombia_ where its population and its institutions strive to attain peace however_ the country conditions_ no matter how difficult_ do not release state party to the american convention of its obligations set forth in this treaty_ which specifically continue in cases such as the instant one the court has argued that when the state conducts or tolerates actions leading to extra legal executions_ not investigating them adequately and not punishing those responsible_ as appropriate_ it breaches the duties to respect rights set forth in the convention and to ensure their free and full exercise_ both by the alleged victim and by his or her next of kin_ it does not allow society to learn what happened_ and it reproduces the conditions of impunity for this type of facts to happen once again

the states parties apply the geneva convention_ indicated that the principle of non refoulement laid down in article was cardinal protection principle enshrined in the convention_ to which no reservations are permitted in many ways_ the principle is the logical complement to the right to seek asylum recognized in the universal declaration of human rights it has come to be considered rule of customary international law binding on all states in addition_ international human rights law has established non refoulement as fundamental component of the absolute prohibition of torture and cruel_ inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment the duty not to refoule is also recognized as applying to refugees irrespective of their formal recognition_ thus obviously including asylum seekers

under international law_ including international humanitarian law and international human rights law and_ in particular_ where applicable_ the convention and the protocol relating to the status of refugees and the principle of non refoulement as contained therein resolution of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe on june the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe adopted the resolution on the interception and rescue at sea of asylum seekers_ refugees and irregular migrants_ which provides as follows the surveillance of europe southern borders has become regional priority the european continent is having to cope with the relatively large scale arrival of migratory flows by sea from africa_ reaching europe mainly through italy_ malta_ spain_ greece and cyprus migrants_ refugees_ asylum seekers and others risk their lives to reach europe southern borders_ mostly in unseaworthy vessels these journeys_ always undertaken illicitly_ mostly on board flagless vessels_ putting them at risk of falling into the hands of migrant smuggling and trafficking rings_ reflect the desperation of the passengers_ who have no legal means and_ above all_ no safer means of reaching europe although the number of arrivals by sea has fallen drastically in recent years_ resulting in shift of migratory routes particularly towards the land border between turkey and greece the parliamentary assembly_ recalling_ inter alia_ its resolution on europe boat people mixed migration flows by sea into southern europe_ once again expresses its deep concern over the measures taken to deal with the arrival by sea of these mixed migratory flows many people in distress at sea have been rescued and many attempting to reach europe have been pushed back_ but the list of fatal incidents as predictable as they are tragic is long one and it is currently getting longer on an almost daily basis furthermore_ recent arrivals in italy and malta following the turmoil in north africa confirm that europe must always be ready to face the possible large scale arrival of irregular migrants_ asylum seekers and refugees on its southern shores the assembly notes that measures to manage these maritime arrivals raise numerous problems_ of which five are particularly worrying despite several relevant international instruments which are applicable in this area and which satisfactorily set out the rights and obligations of states and individuals applicable in this area_ interpretations of their content appear to differ some states do not agree on the nature and extent of their in specific situations and some states also call into question the application of the principle of non refoulement on the high seas while the absolute priority in the event of interception at sea is the swift disembarkation of those rescued to place of safety the notion of place of safety does not appear to be interpreted in the same way by all member states yet it is clear that the notion of place of safety should not be restricted solely to the physical protection of people_ but necessarily also entails respect for their fundamental rights divergences of this kind directly endanger the lives of the people to be rescued_ in particular by delaying or preventing rescue measures_ and they are likely to dissuade seafarers from rescuing people in distress at sea furthermore_ they could result in violation of the principle of non refoulement in respect of number of persons_ including some in need of international protection although the european agency for the management of operational cooperation at the external borders of the member states of the european union frontex plays an ever increasing role in interception at sea_ there are inadequate guarantees of respect for human rights and obligations arising under international and european union law_ in the context of the joint operations it coordinates finally_ these sea arrivals place burden on the states located on the southern borders of the european union the goal of being shared more fairly and greater solidarity in the migration sphere between european states is far from being attained the situation is rendered more complex by the fact that these migratory flows are of mixed nature and therefore call for specialised and tailored protection sensitive responses in keeping with the status of those rescued to respond to sea arrivals adequately and in line with the relevant international standards_ the states must take account of this aspect in their migration management policies and activities the assembly reminds member states of their obligations under international law_ including the european convention on human rights ets no the united nations convention on the law of the sea of and the geneva convention relating to the status of refugees_ and particularly reminds them of the principle of non refoulement and the right to seek asylum the assembly also reiterates the obligations of the states parties to the international convention for the safety of life at sea and the international convention on maritime search and rescue finally and above all_ the assembly reminds member states that they have both moral and legal obligation to save persons in distress at sea without the slightest delay_ and unequivocally reiterates the interpretation given by the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr which states that the principle of non refoulement is equally applicable on the high seas the high seas are not an area where states are exempt from their legal obligations_ including those emerging from international human rights law and international refugee law accordingly_ the assembly calls on member states_ when conducting maritime border surveillance operations_ whether in the context of preventing smuggling and trafficking in human beings or in connection with border management_ be it in the exercise of de jure or de facto jurisdiction_ to fulfil without exception and without delay their obligation to save people in distress at sea ensure that their border management policies and activities_ including interception measures_ recognise the mixed make up of flows of individuals attempting to cross maritime borders guarantee for all intercepted persons humane treatment and systematic respect for their human rights_ including the principle of non

clarity regarding the respective of european union states and frontex and the absence of adequate guarantees for the respect of fundamental rights and international standards in the framework of joint operations coordinated by that agency while the assembly welcomes the proposals presented by the european commission to amend the rules governing that agency_ with view to strengthening guarantees of

unhcr published the following press release unhcr expressed deep concern thursday over the fate of some people who were rescued wednesday by italian patrol boats in the maltese search and rescue region sar of responsibility and sent back to libya without proper assessment of their possible protection needs the rescue took place about nautical miles south east of the italian island of lampedusa_ but within the maltese sar zone the diversion to libya followed day of heated discussions between maltese and italian authorities about who was responsible for the rescue and disembarkation of the people on the three boats_ which were in distress although closer to lampedusa_ the vessels were in the maltese search and rescue area of responsibility while no information is available on the nationalities of those aboard the vessels_ it is likely that among them are people in need of international protection in an estimated percent of sea arrivals in italy applied for asylum and percent of them were granted some form of protection appeal to the italian and maltese authorities to continue to ensure that people rescued at sea and in need of international protection receive full access to territory and asylum procedures_ un high commissioner for refugees antónio guterres said the incident marks significant shift in policies by the italian government and is source of very serious concern unhcr deeply regrets the lack of transparency which surrounded the event we have been working closely with the italian authorities in lampedusa and elsewhere to ensure that people fleeing war and persecution are protected in line with the geneva convention_ said laurens jolles_ unhcr rome based representative it is of fundamental importance that the international principle of non refoulement continues to be fully respected in addition_ libya has not signed the un refugee convention_ and does not have functioning national asylum system unhcr urges italian authorities to reconsider their decision and to avoid repeating such measures letter of july from mr jacques barrot_ vice president of the european commission on july mr jacques barrot wrote to the president of the european parliament committee on civil liberties_ justice and home affairs in response to request for legal opinion on the return to libya by sea of various groups of migrants by the italian authorities in that letter_ the vice president of the european commission expressed himself as follows according to information available to the commission_ the migrants concerned were intercepted on the high seas two sets of community rules must be examined concerning the situation of nationals of third countries or stateless persons attempting to enter_ unlawfully_ the territory of member states_ some of whom might be in need of international protection firstly_ the community acquis in the field of asylum is intended to safeguard the right of asylum_ as set forth in article of the charter of fundamental rights of the european union_ and in accordance with the geneva convention relating to the status of refugees and with other relevant treaties however_ that acquis_ including the asylum procedures directive_ applies only to asylum applications made on the territory of member states_ which includes the borders_ transit areas and_ in the context of maritime borders_ territorial waters of member states consequently_ it is clear from legal standpoint that the community acquis in the field of asylum does not apply to situations on the high seas secondly_ the schengen borders code sbc requires that member states conduct border surveillance to prevent_ inter alia_ unauthorised border crossings article of ec regulation no sbc however_ that community obligation must be fulfilled in compliance with the principle of non refoulement and without prejudice to the rights of refugees and other people requesting international protection the commission is of the opinion that border surveillance activities conducted at sea_ whether in territorial waters_ the contiguous zone_ the exclusive economic zone or on the high seas_ fall within the scope of application of the sbc in that connection_ our preliminary legal analysis would suggest that the activities of the italian border guards correspond to the notion of border surveillance as set forth in article of the sbc_ because they prevented the unauthorised crossing of an external sea border by the persons concerned and resulted in them being returned to the third country of departure according to the case law of the european court of justice_ community obligations must be applied in strict compliance with the fundamental rights forming part of the general principles of community law the court has also clarified that the scope of application of those rights in the community legal system must be determined taking account of the case law of the european court of human rights echr the principle of non refoulement_ as interpreted by the echr_ essentially means that states must refrain from returning person directly or indirectly to place where he or she could face real risk of being subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment furthermore_ states may not send refugees back to territories where their life or freedom would be threatened for reasons of race_ religion_ nationality_ membership of particular social group or political opinion that obligation must be fulfilled when carrying out any border control in accordance with the sbc_ including border surveillance activities on the high seas the case law of the echr provides that acts carried out on the high seas by state vessel constitute cases of jurisdiction and may engage the responsibility of the state concerned having regard to the foregoing concerning the scope of community jurisdiction_ the commission has invited the italian authorities to provide it with additional information concerning the actual circumstances of the return of the persons concerned to libya and the provisions put in place to ensure compliance with the principle of non refoulement when implementing the bilateral agreement between the two countries report of the council of europe committee for the prevention of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment cpt from to july delegation from the cpt visited italy during that visit the delegation looked into various issues arising from the new governmental policy of intercepting at sea_ and returning to libya_ migrants approaching italy southern maritime border in particular_ the delegation focused on the system of safeguards in place to ensure that no one was sent to country where there were substantial grounds for believing that he or she would run real risk of being subjected to torture or ill treatment in its report_ made public on april the cpt expressed the opinion that italy policy of intercepting migrants at sea and obliging them to return to libya or other non european countries violated the principle of non refoulement the committee emphasised that italy was bound by the principle of non refoulement wherever it exercised its jurisdiction_ which included via its personnel and vessels engaged in border protection or rescue at sea_ even when operating outside its territory moreover_ all persons coming within italy jurisdiction should be afforded an appropriate opportunity and facilities to seek international protection the information available to the cpt indicated that no such opportunity or facilities were afforded to the migrants intercepted at sea by the italian authorities during the period examined on the contrary_ the persons who were pushed back to libya in the operations carried out from may to july were denied the right to obtain an individual assessment of their case and effective access to the refugee protection system in that connection_ the cpt observed that persons surviving sea voyage were particularly vulnerable and often not in condition in which they should be expected to declare immediately their wish to apply for asylum according to the cpt report_ libya could not be considered safe country in terms of human rights and refugee law the situation of persons arrested and detained in libya_ including that of migrants who were also exposed to being deported to other countries indicated that the persons pushed back to libya were at risk of ill treatment the report by human rights watch in lengthy report published on september and entitled pushed back_ pushed around italy forced return of boat migrants and asylum seekers_ libya mistreatment of migrants and asylum seekers human rights watch condemned the italian practice of intercepting boats full of migrants on the high seas and pushing them back to libya without the required screening that report was also based on the results of research published in report entitled libya stemming the flow abuses against migrants_ asylum seekers and refugees according to human rights watch_ italian patrol boats towed migrant boats from international waters without determining whether some might contain refugees_ sick or injured persons_ pregnant women_ unaccompanied children_ or victims of trafficking or other forms of violence the italian authorities forced the boat migrants onto libyan vessels or took the migrants directly back to libya_ where the authorities immediately detained them some of the operations were coordinated by frontex the report was based on interviews with ninety one migrants_ asylum seekers_ and refugees in italy and malta_ conducted mostly in may and one telephone interview with migrant detainee in libya representatives of human rights watch visited libya in april and met with government officials_ but the libyan authorities would not permit the organisation to interview migrants privately moreover_ the authorities did not allow human rights watch to visit any of the many migrant detention centres in libya_ despite repeated requests unhcr now has access to misrata prison_ at which clandestine migrants are generally held_ and libyan organisations provide humanitarian services there however_ there is no formal agreement_ and thus no guaranteed access furthermore_ libya has no asylum law the authorities make no distinction between refugees_ asylum seekers and other clandestine migrants human rights watch urged the libyan government to improve the deplorable conditions of detention in libya and to establish asylum procedures that conformed to international refugee standards it also called on the italian government_ the european union and frontex to ensure access to asylum_ including for those intercepted on the high seas_ and to refrain from returning non libyans to libya until the latter treatment of migrants_ asylum seekers and refugees fully met international standards amnesty international visit team from amnesty international carried out fact finding visit to libya from to may the first such visit to the country by the organisation that the libyan authorities had permitted since during that visit_ amnesty international visited misrata detention centre_ some km from tripoli_ in which several hundred irregular migrants from other african countries were held in severely overcrowded conditions_ and briefly interviewed several of those held there many had been detained since they were intercepted while seeking to make their way to italy or other countries in southern europe which look to libya and other north african countries to staunch the flow of irregular migrants from sub saharan africa to europe amnesty international considered it possible that detainees at misrata might include refugees fleeing persecution and stressed that_ as libya had no asylum procedure and was not party to the refugee convention or its protocol_ foreigners_ including those in need of international protection_ might find themselves outside the protection of the law there was also virtually no opportunity for detainees to lodge complaints of torture and other ill treatment with the competent judicial authorities in its meetings with libyan government officials_ amnesty international expressed concern about the detention and alleged ill treatment of hundreds_ possibly thousands_ of foreign nationals whom the authorities assumed to be irregular migrants and urged them to put in place proper procedures to identify asylum seekers and refugees and afford them appropriate protection amnesty international also urged the libyan authorities to cease forcible returns of foreign nationals to countries in which they were at risk of serious human rights violations and to find better alternative to detention for those foreigners whom they were not able to return to their countries of origin for this reason some of the eritrean nationals who comprised sizeable proportion of the foreign nationals detained at misrata told amnesty international that they had been held there for two years other international material describing the situation in libya in addition to those cited above_ numerous reports have been published by national and international organisations and by non governmental organisations_ condemning the conditions of detention and the living conditions of irregular migrants in libya the principal reports are human rights watch_ stemming the flow abuses against migrants_ asylum seekers and refugees september ii united nations human rights committee_ concluding

 H.F. AND OTHERS v. FRANCE,the factsbackground to the case the applicants and were born in and respectively the applicants and were both born in in and the applicants daughters travelled to syria on their own initiative with their respective partners see paragraphs and below their decision to leave was part of broader movement in which nationals from several european states went to iraq or syria to join daesh the so called islamic state in iraq and the levant or isil also known as isis the conflict in north eastern syria by the time of the applicants daughters departure_ daesh was reaching its maximum territorial expansion in iraq and syria and was announcing the foundation of caliphate under the leadership of abu bakr al baghdadi in an international coalition of seventy six states operation inherent resolve with the participation of france which mainly provided air support was mobilised to provide military support to local forces engaged in the fight against daesh_ including the syrian democratic forces the sdf dominated by the kurdish militia of the people protection units yekîneyên parastina gel the ypg the armed wing of the democratic union party the latter established itself as the de facto political and administrative authority over territory that gradually extended to the whole of north eastern syria as daesh retreated the sdf mainly comprises the ypg together with the women protection units the ypj arab fighters and the syriac military council since syrian kurdistan_ de facto autonomous region_ has had its own administration in early democratic autonomous administration of rojava was proclaimed in it was strengthened and renamed the autonomous administration of north and east syria the aanes in daesh lost control of the city of raqqa_ its capital_ to the sdf from march onwards_ following the fall of the last territorial retreat in al baghuz_ on the eastern fringe of syria_ the sdf controlled all syrian territory east of the euphrates river the sdf offensive caused tens of thousands of men_ women and children to flee_ the majority of them families of daesh fighters most of them_ including the applicants daughters_ were reportedly arrested by the sdf during and following the final battle_ and taken to al hol camp between december and march following the announcement of the withdrawal of us forces_ the turkish military took control in october of border region in north eastern syria this led the sdf to reach some local security arrangements with the syrian regime but also with russia clandestine cells of daesh remain active in the region camps of al hol and roj the al hol and roj camps were placed under the military control of the sdf and are run by the aanes according to the international committee of the red cross_ people were living in al hol camp as of july at that time its regional director described the situation in the camps as apocalyptic according to press release issued on march following visit by its president_ this figure was reduced to two thirds of whom were children_ many of them orphaned or separated from family the press release further stated that those children were growing up in harsh and often very dangerous conditions the majority of the people held in al hol camp were syrian or iraqi more than people from other countries_ of fifty seven different nationalities_ are reported to be_ still today_ in an area of the camp known as the annex according to the government_ the area of the camp set aside for foreign families_ in which french nationals are held is exclusively inhabited by members of daesh who perpetuate that group threats on the spot and outside by the start of the activity of the humanitarian organisations had been greatly reduced owing to the critical security situation in the camp according to the government_ this situation led the sdf to carry out security operation in the camp from march to april outside the annex reserved for foreigners_ leading to the arrest of about one hundred members of daesh this situation explains_ according to them_ why sdf representatives have difficulties accessing certain areas of the camp and why it is difficult for them to identify and locate precisely the persons held in the foreigners annex roj camp_ located to the north of al hol and surrounded by oil fields_ is significantly smaller in order to address the overcrowding of al hol camp_ transfers of people held in the annex took place during the year according to the report by the non governmental organisation ngo reach_ published in october individuals were being held in roj camp_ of whom were children_ of them aged or under according to the ngo rights and security international rsi see paragraphs and below it is more difficult to obtain information about this camp_ as it is reported to be under tighter control and its occupants are virtually unable to communicate with the outside world in decision no of may the défenseur des droits described the living conditions of children in the camps as follows the extreme conditions in which french children are held in camps under the control of the syrian democratic forces in northern syria are notorious and the health situation in these camps has been widely reported these children are not safe french child aged one and half died in roj camp in mid september hit by military vehicle on march an day old infant died of pneumonia in statement on january the world health organization who reported the deaths of twenty nine children and newborns in al hol camp in two months_ most of whom were suffering from hypothermia in its opinion on french children held in syrian camps of september the national advisory commission on human rights commission nationale consultative des droits de homme stressed the extreme vulnerability of the children in the camps of the rojava region_ most of whom were under five years of age and who were particularly exposed to unhealthy living conditions also having severe physical and mental health problems according to the rsi report published on november entitled europe guantanamo the indefinite detention of european women and children in north east syria children and women of french nationality were being held in the camps of al hol and roj of the people who died in in al hol camp_ were children in august aid workers had indicated that the death rate of children had tripled_ with eight children dying between and august according to the report children held in both camps suffered from malnutrition_ dehydration_ sometimes war injuries and post traumatic stress and were reportedly at risk of violence and sexual exploitation the weather conditions were extreme the detention conditions were inhumane and degrading there was an atmosphere of violence_ caused by tensions between women still adhering to isil and others_ as well as by the violent conduct of the camp guards see also paragraph below in its report of october abandoned to torture dehumanising rights violations against children and women in northeast syria rsi concluded that the conditions endured by women and children of foreign nationalities in the al hol and roj camps were exposing them to treatment that could be characterised as torture it noted that those women and children were constantly threatened with serious injury or death and faced real risk of sexual or other physical violence_ comparing their detention to that of prisoners on death row it referred to report by the ngo save the children_ which had established that about two children had died every week in al hol camp between january and september and that seventy nine individuals had been murdered_ including three children_ who had been shot rsi further pointed out that the women and children were being held arbitrarily and for an indefinite duration_ often on the sole basis of their presumed links with members of isil_ and in many cases incommunicado_ with no possibility of communicating with the outside world_ not even with their families or with lawyers_ leaving them in legal limbo repatriations by france between march and january france organised the repatriation of children from camps in north eastern syria on case by case basis on the practice of other states_ see paragraphs to and below it sent five missions to syria and repatriated thirty five french minors_ orphans_ unaccompanied minors or humanitarian cases in press release of march the ministry for european and foreign affairs the foreign ministry stated that france had repatriated several orphaned minors under the age of five from the camps in north eastern syria these children are undergoing special medical and psychological monitoring and have been entrusted to the judicial authorities the relatives concerned_ who were in contact with the ministry_ have been informed france thanks the syrian democratic forces for their cooperation_ which made this outcome possible the decision was taken in view of the situation of these very young and particularly vulnerable children as regards adult nationals fighters and jihadists who followed daesh in the levant france position has not changed they must be tried on the territory where they committed their crimes it is question of both justice and security in subsequent press releases_ dated june june and january it was stated that france was grateful to local officials in north eastern syria for their cooperation_ which made this outcome possible and that these particularly vulnerable minors were able to be collected in accordance with the authorisations given by local officials in press release of july the foreign ministry announced that france had organised the return to national territory of thirty five minors of french nationality and sixteen mothers in letter of july the applicants lawyer informed the court that their daughters and grandchildren were not among the french nationals repatriated_ as confirmed by the government in letter of july aanes statement of march concerning repatriation of foreign nationals prior to the above development_ in the aanes published statement which read as follows after the liberation of al baghouz and the military fall of isis_ the war effort against isis entered new phase thousands of isis detainees and their families as well as the sleeper cells have posed serious challenges for the autonomous administration of north and east syria aanes we_ as aanes believe that the children need to get out of the radical atmosphere in the camps_ and receive proper rehabilitation to live normal life therefore_ we handed over orphaned children to official bodies from their countries based on our humanitarian approach however_ the number of repatriation cases is still low as for women and their children_ we_ from the very beginning_ have followed and abided by the relevant laws that do not permit separating the mothers from their children_ except in some very special humanitarian cases_ and at the request of some mothers after getting their written consent we have called on the international community on several occasions to repatriate women who were victims of isis and who we do not have any proof against the response was insufficient_ and some countries insisted to repatriate the children without the mothers with regard to isis fighters_ who belong to more than countries_ the aanes submitted request_ on march to the international community and the countries that have isis members in our custody_ to establish an international tribunal or hybrid domestic international tribunal to try them in accordance with international laws until now_ we have not received enough cooperation and response as for the syrians_ they are being tried according to the local laws procedures_ but the foreigners constitute burden_ and we need the cooperation of their countries and the international community the aanes suffer from huge difficulties to accommodate isis fighters and their families this file constitutes great burden on us_ which we cannot bear on our own_ and the international community should assume its to help us address this file also_ isis is still organized in terms of ideology in our region_ and there is clear support for isis through the cells who receive support from the turkish occupied regions the aanes rejects the claims that isis fighters are illegally detained in our region_ as we repeatedly called on establishing tribunal to prosecute them the aanes welcomes the cooperation with the international community on the issues of repatriating the children_ solving the issue of women_ and making reparation for the victims in conclusion_ we affirm that we welcome legal cooperation and international expertise in order to provide support for the tribunal_ which we want to be hybrid domestic international we request international cooperation with us to resolve this issue_ which does not concern us only_ but is the responsibility of the entire world we reiterate that our appeals did not receive the necessary response_ and there is an exacerbation of the situation_ especially in the camps_ which creates huge difficulties for us situation of the applicants daughters and grandchildren since leaving for no the applicants daughter_ who was born in in paris_ left france on july together with her partner to

progress being made by her son for their part_ the government stated that they were not in position to confirm or deny the presence of and her child in roj camp proceedings brought to seek no in an email sent on october to the foreign ministry_ which remained unanswered_ the applicants requested the repatriation of their daughter_ who was very weak together with their grandchildren_ drawing attention to her reiterated wish to return to france she could not return because she was alone with two small children and had no money and to the danger for the life of the grandchildren in view of their state of health they stated that their daughter had done nothing wrong and had been manipulated in by the now deceased father of her children in an application registered on april they called upon the urgent applications judge of the paris administrative court_ on the basis of article of the administrative courts code see paragraph below to enjoin the foreign ministry to organise the repatriation of their daughter and grandchildren to france_ arguing that their family members were exposed to inhuman and degrading treatment and to serious and manifestly unlawful infringement of their right to life they stated that the repatriation of the children was justified on obvious humanitarian grounds_ as the inhuman conditions of detention in the camp had been documented by numerous international organisations they claimed that the state had responsibility_ as part of its positive obligations_ to protect individuals under its jurisdiction_ stating that the responsibility of the state concern ed both individuals on its territory and its nationals present in an area outside the national territory over which it exercise control in practice the repatriation of five orphaned children held in this camp on march had highlighted the decision making and operational capacity of the foreign ministry to organise and carry out the repatriation of the children in support of their application they produced their request for repatriation of october and the requests submitted to the french president few months earlier by their counsel_ on behalf of several women and children who were held in the camps in north eastern syria_ together with the response of the president chief of staff this response stated that the individuals concerned had deliberately left to join terrorist organisation at war with the coalition in which france was participating_ and that it was up to the local authorities to decide whether they were liable for any offences it explained that if no liability on their part were to be found_ france would take steps appropriate to their situation in the light of the warrant issued against them it contained the french government position_ as set out in note entitled requests for the repatriation of french nationals held in the levant as follows by way of reminder these individuals left of their own volition to join terrorist organisation that has committed acts of unprecedented violence against the local population in this area this terrorist organisation has committed and is still planning attacks in france which have already caused numerous victims the issue of the repatriation of these people who_ after having joined daesh_ are now being held by the authorities and military forces that have liberated the territories formerly controlled by the terrorist organisation_ cannot be separated from the context of the war in the region_ in which they took part in syria_ this war is not even over_ as fighting continues and the institutional situation has not been stabilised their situation must be assessed in line with international lawfulness and in the context of relations with the states in which they are held and_ lastly_ of the legal proceedings already underway_ or likely to be brought_ whether abroad or in france with regard to french nationals arrested in turkey_ the government have negotiated protocol that makes it possible to obtain the expulsion of these individuals adults or minors to france_ where they are dealt with by the judicial authority as soon as they arrive with regard to french adults detained in iraq_ they are first and foremost the responsibility of the iraqi authorities_ who have the discretion to decide whether they should be subject to legal proceedings in that country these individuals are entitled to ordinary consular protection this protection includes the exercise of visiting rights and_ in particular_ verification that the persons in question are not subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment within the meaning of the european convention on human rights our diplomatic network stands ready for that purpose with regard to the french adults detained in syria_ france does not have diplomatic relations with this country_ which is still war zone in many places this is why our intervention is carried out first and foremost through the international organisations that are present in such situations_ and in particular via the international committee of the red cross it is up to the local authorities to decide on any liability of these french adults for offences committed in this territory on account of their membership of terrorist organisation concerning the possible imposition of the death penalty france_ which is opposed to the death penalty_ intervenes to systematically remind the authorities concerned of this position_ in the context of the exercise of consular protection this protection_ as provided for by the vienna convention of april can be provided to any french national detained_ arrested or imprisoned abroad who so wishes_ and where it is materially possible with regard to the right to fair trial_ it goes without saying that france is committed to respecting the safeguards afforded by fair trial it will provide all support to its nationals in the context of consular protection in this connection_ within the limits allowed by international law_ as provided for in the vienna conventions of april and april france may not_ however_ interfere in the internal affairs of state or take any coercive action on foreign territory french minors in iraq or syria are entitled to the protection of france and may be taken care of_ according to the rules concerning the protection of minors_ and repatriated_ provided that their criminal liability has been ruled out by the local authorities when adults return to france_ they are of course systematically dealt with_ as soon as they arrive in france_ by the judicial authority_ which determines their criminal liability as regards minors returning to france_ if the judicial authority rules out any criminal liability_ they are systematically subjected to special monitoring_ particularly of medical and psychological nature_ under the supervision of juvenile judge in decision of april the urgent applications judge dismissed the applicants case the requested repatriation of french nationals held outside france_ in zone under the control of foreign forces_ would necessitate measures which are indissociable from france external action it thus constitutes_ as does any refusal to carry it out_ an act which falls outside the jurisdiction of the administrative courts in two letters dated april counsel for the applicants again wrote to the french president and to the foreign ministry seeking the repatriation of and her two children in letter of april the president chief of staff acknowledged receipt thereof the applicants appealed against the decision of april before the conseil état they pointed out that the condition of urgency was satisfied and acknowledged by the french authorities_ which had already repatriated five children on march they emphasised the worsening health and safety conditions in the camps and complained that there was no judicial review of the french authorities refusal to put an end to the inhuman and degrading treatment or risk of death to which and her two children were exposed in addition to relying on the state obligations under articles and of the convention_ they alleged that the state inaction had deprived their family members of their right to return to france in breach of article of protocol no to the convention in written observations before the conseil état_ by way of principal argument the foreign ministry raised the objection that the requested measure fell within the category of acts of state see paragraphs et seq below that could not be adjudicated upon by the courts it stated that the requested repatriation would require the negotiation of an agreement between the french state and the foreign authorities which exercised control over the french nationals_ together with the deployment of material and human resources_ generally of military nature_ in the territory concerned it concluded that the implementation of an assistance measure such as the requested repatriation was indissociable from the conduct of foreign relations and could not be ordered by court of law by way of alternative argument_ the ministry submitted that_ since france had no jurisdiction over its nationals held in syria_ the applicants could not validly claim that the state had breached its convention obligations emphasising the essentially territorial application of the convention_ it stated that the factual circumstances under examination were not such as to engage the state responsibility_ as france did not exercise any control over the nationals concerned through its agents_ or any territorial control over the camps_ not having any decisive political or military control over north eastern syria in that connection it indicated that france participation in the international coalition did not suffice for it to be considered that it exercised decisive influence over the territory nor did it exercise control through any subordinate local administration the ministry explained_ lastly_ that the previous repatriation of number of unaccompanied minors did not indicate any effective control over the zone_ pointing out that this operation had been the result of an agreement with the sdf following negotiation process in the further alternative_ the ministry asserted that the applicants allegation that there was positive obligation to repatriate had no basis in international law it explained that the previous repatriation of number of minors had been decided in the light of humanitarian considerations and that the situation of children was examined on case by case basis according to their interests in decision of april no the conseil état dismissed the applicants case as follows the aim of the application was to secure either the state intervention vis vis foreign authorities in foreign territory in order to organise the repatriation to france of its nationals_ or the taking of measures by the state itself to ensure their return from territory outside its sovereignty the measures thus sought with view to the said repatriation_ which cannot be arranged solely by issuing permit to cross the french border_ as was requested at the hearing_ would require negotiations to be opened with foreign authorities or an intervention on foreign territory they cannot be dissociated from the conduct of france international relations consequently_ court of law has no jurisdiction to hear the case application no in two letters of april which remained unanswered_ to the foreign ministry and the french president_ the applicants lawyer sought the urgent repatriation of and her child to france they submitted an application to that effect to the urgent applications judge of the paris administrative court_ arguing that the urgency was established in view of the proven risk of death and inhuman or degrading treatment to which adults and children were exposed in al hol camp in decision of may the urgent applications judge dismissed their request on the grounds that he did not have jurisdiction to examine it_ as the requested measure was indissociable from france international relations in syria in decision of may he gave similar ruling on the request to set aside the ministry tacit decision to refuse the repatriation the case was similarly dismissed on the merits by decision of the same date in decision of september the conseil état declared inadmissible an appeal on points of law lodged by the applicants against the decision of may in accordance with article of the administrative courts code manifestly ill founded appeal following procedure which required neither an adversarial investigation nor public hearing the following reasons were given for its decision first_ while the applicants maintain that the urgent applications judge should have_ at the very least_ examined their argument that their application did not fall within the category of measures that were indissociable from the conduct of france international relations in so far as the french state had already repatriated eighteen children held in syrian camps since march and that it had even intervened urgently in april to repatriate child whose life was in danger as result of the health crisis caused by the covid epidemic_ the circumstances thus alleged could not be appropriately invoked before the urgent applications judge to argue that the administrative courts would have jurisdiction to hear their application consequently_ the urgent applications judge of the administrative court_ who was not required to take account of the applicants arguments in listing the relevant documents in his decision_ or_ having regard to the content of the arguments_ to respond to the claim that the administrative court had jurisdiction to hear the application_ did not render his decision unlawful third_ the urgent applications judge of the administrative court did not commit mistake of law or fail in his duty in holding that the applicants application sought to enjoin the state to take measure which was indissociable from the conduct of france international relations in syria_ and in thus rejecting that application on the ground that it was manifest that the administrative court did not have jurisdiction to examine it in parallel the applicants brought an action before the paris tribunal judiciaire general first instance court to establish the existence of an illegal administrative act_ on the grounds that the french authorities had wilfully omitted to put an end to the arbitrariness of the detention of their daughter and grandson and had refused to arrange their repatriation they argued that the unlawful detention was ongoing_ putting their family members in mortal danger_ but that the state had not attempted to act in any way to resolve the situation in judgment of may the court declared that it had no jurisdiction in the following terms while the french state has duty to protect its nationals_ this being related to the right of all persons not to be subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment_ and to the need to uphold the best interests of the child_ the constitutional principle of the separation of powers enshrined in article of the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen of implies_ according to settled case law_ that certain acts of the administration fall outside any judicial supervision of either an administrative or general court_ including in respect of an illegal administrative act or violation of fundamental right protected by the constitution or the convention the repatriation of french nationals held abroad is in itself matter for diplomatic action by france_ and all the more so in this particular case since it cannot be seen from the evidence in the case file that france exercises effective control over the territory in which al hol camp is located_ thus implying that the french state would have to enter into negotiations that cannot be imposed by an ordinary court of law accordingly_ this court has no jurisdiction to rule on the application this conclusion does not entail any denial of justice or any infringement of the right to fair hearing or the right to an effective remedy_ as guaranteed in particular by articles and of the convention_ in so far as the limitation on judicial review of administrative acts pursues legitimate aim_ namely to ensure the separation of governmental and judicial powers_ concerns only limited number of acts_ the classification of which may_ moreover_ give rise to judicial review_ and does not preclude other forms of supervision_ in particular political and civic supervision_ of the said acts relevant legal framework and law and lawarticle of the administrative courts code this provision provides as follows where such an application is submitted to him or her as an urgent matter_ the urgent applications judge may order whatever measures are necessary to protect fundamental freedom which has been breached in serious and manifestly unlawful manner by public law entity or an organisation under private law responsible for managing public service_ in the exercise of their powers the urgent applications judge shall make ruling within forty eight hours the acts of state doctrine concept of acts of state the acts of state doctrine is of jurisprudential origin an act of state is one that is regarded as falling outside the jurisdiction of the courts_ which have no power to review its legality or to assess any defects while no general or theoretical definition of this concept emerges from the case law of the administrative courts_ it can be seen that it covers acts which involve relations between public authorities_ in particular the government relations with parliament_ and those involving relations with foreign state or an international organisation_ more generally concerning the state international relations as to the latter category_ the jurisdictional immunity can be explained by the courts concern not to become involved in diplomatic or international action_ as it is regarded as falling outside the supervision of the courts acts of state thus

president_ as reported by the press on march to organise the repatriation of french children in camps of north eastern syria on case by case basis ce_ no see paragraph below the public rapporteur addressed as follows the question whether or not the matter was dissociable from diplomatic relations it is your task to examine any shortcomings in public administration_ including the diplomatic or consular services_ when the matter concerns merely the relations between france and its nationals_ even where the decision has military or diplomatic background however_ it is not your task to hear disputes which are directly associated with inter state relations and which would mean passing judgment on and interfering with france foreign policy the test is whether france may act_ or has acted_ alone_ by means of administrative action_ even at the cost of certain diplomatic tensions_ or if the criticism against it concerns its attitude or inaction with regard to foreign authority in the latter case you can entertain jurisdiction only if the act is part of an international cooperation provided for by treaty_ thus obliging france to take action_ as if an administrative public service had been instituted and its conditions of operation were bound to fall within your remit relevant case law in decision of december no the conseil état held that the minister decision to recognise the diplomatic status of foreign institution fell outside the jurisdiction of the administrative courts_ without infringing the right to remedy guaranteed by article of the convention in her submissions_ the public rapporteur relied on markovic and others italy gc no echr xiv in emphasising that acts of state were compatible with the convention in two decisions of april nos and upheld by decisions of the conseil état of april nos and delivered on the same day as that concerning application no the urgent applications judge dismissed applications for the repatriation of two mothers and their children held in roj camp as follows it is incumbent on the state_ as guarantor of the constitutional principle of the right to the protection of human dignity_ to ensure that the right of every person not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment is guaranteed the same applies to the principle of respect for the best interests of the child_ as pointed out by the constitutional council in its decision no qpc of march such obligations are imposed on the state as part of its general duty to protect its nationals on french territory_ but also outside its borders however_ the repatriation of french nationals held in foreign territory is subject to prior negotiations between the french state and the authorities controlling that territory_ with the deployment of specific_ possibly military_ resources in the territory concerned in the present case_ it is clear from the investigation that roj camp in north eastern syria_ where the individuals whose repatriation is requested are being held_ is governed by foreign armed groups the production of press articles and list of names of persons held in this camp_ containing information of little relevance_ have failed to establish that france exercises control over this territory_ particularly through the presence of state agents consequently_ the organisation or lack of organisation of the repatriation of the individuals concerned cannot be dissociated from the conduct of france foreign relations in decision of september no in an appeal on points of law against decision of the president of the paris administrative court of appeal confirming the rejection of request to annul the decision of the president of the republic to organise on case by case basis the repatriation of french children in camps in north eastern syria_ the conseil état examined request for referral of priority question of qpc as to whether the administrative courts finding that they had no jurisdiction to adjudicate upon diplomatic acts was compatible with the right to an effective judicial remedy_ as guaranteed by article of the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen it found that there was no cause to refer the question to the constitutional council_ as there were no legislative provisions applicable to the dispute_ and considered that the appellants arguments were not such as to allow the appeal to be admitted in his opinion on this case_ the public rapporteur set out the following response to the question whether the conseil état should have jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the above mentioned decision as the urgent applications judge of the conseil état noted in decisions of april and in order to repatriate french national it is not sufficient to authorise his or her return to france france must also negotiate the principle and conditions of repatriation with the foreign authorities of the country concerned or_ as in the present case_ with the de facto authorities exercising control over part of the country or intervene directly_ militarily_ in this territory outside its sovereignty_ as would seem to be accepted_ to certain extent_ by international law no international convention specifically provides for such operations the actions requested by the applicants cannot therefore be dissociated from the conduct of international relations it is true that_ prior to any approach that might be made to foreign authorities_ repatriation presupposes that france is willing to take back its nationals the idea_ criticised in the present case_ of selective repatriation of french minors in syria_ seems to be informed at least as much by considerations of domestic policy in particular public security_ as by foreign policy you could thus consider analysing the decision of the president of the republic as refusal to envisage full repatriation_ independently of any diplomatic or military considerations on which its implementation would depend_ then reviewing that refusal autonomously and_ if necessary_ annulling it on the grounds that it reflects disregard for the obligation to protect french nationals or fundamental rights the negative nature of the decision would make it easier to dissociate but such dissociation would be completely artificial and_ above all_ completely futile from judicial standpoint_ because you would not be entitled to order the state to carry out the repatriation_ or even to contact any foreign authority to organise it_ without stepping outside your jurisdiction private member bill for the creation of right to judicial review of acts of state as regards the protection of fundamental rights no this private member bill was filed on january in the national assembly but was not taken further the explanatory memorandum indicated that the question of the repatriation of children of jihadists held in syria raised the issue of the protection of fundamental rights in relation to decisions of the french state it argued that political regime in which acts of the executive could not be subject to judicial review was incompatible with the concept of the rule of law the addition of an article in the administrative courts code was proposed so that the jurisdiction of the conseil état would be recognised_ at first and last instances_ to adjudicate upon complaints against acts of the government or the president of the republic relating to diplomatic or international relations and having consequences for the situation of those individuals concerned by such acts as regards the protection of fundamental rights guaranteed by the constitution_ the european convention on human rights and international treaties criminal lawcriminal court jurisdiction in respect of acts committed abroad

on provisions to be made for minors on their return from areas of terrorist group operations in particular the syria iraq border area superseding the previous instruction of march indicates the arrangements made for minors on their return_ stating as follows in the introduction these children may have witnessed abuse and it can be assumed that all these minors_ whatever their age_ have grown up in climate of extreme violence faced with this exceptional situation_ it is necessary to put in place specific measures of care and support for these minors_ adapted to their age and individual situations_ to provide for the coordination and implementation of ordinary protection mechanisms_ and to take into account the need for training and support for the staff who will be responsible for them the arrangements concern all french minors_ or those presumed to be so by the consular authorities abroad_ as well as all foreign minors who are present on french territory after having spent time in the iraqi syrian zone or other areas of operation of terrorist groups for those who are apprehended with their families before their return to france_ the instruction indicates that the consular post is to provide consular protection within the usual framework of the vienna convention on consular relations adopted on april unts the vienna convention see paragraph below allowing in

the states of which they were nationals under article of the above mentioned vienna convention_ refusal by the french state to make an application for free legal aid from foreign state for the benefit of one of its nationals and to represent him or her in court did not breach the state duties under that provision international law and the concept of nationality was examined by the international court of justice in its judgment in nottebohm liechtenstein guatemala_ judgment of april icj reports where it was defined as follows nationality is legal bond having as its basis social fact of attachment_ genuine connection of existence_ interests and sentiments_ together with the existence of reciprocal rights and duties it may be said to constitute the juridical expression of the fact that the individual upon whom it is conferred_ either directly by the law or as the result of an act of the authorities_ is in fact more closely connected with the population of the state conferring nationality than with that of any other state the state personal jurisdiction abroad is exclusively related to nationality the bond of nationality justifies the exercise by the state of its jurisdiction in respect of individuals when they are abroad_ as illustrated by the principle of jurisdiction on the basis of nationality in french criminal law_ known as the active personality principle see paragraph above in terms of rights and duties_ the two key legal consequences of nationality under international law_ from the state perspective_ are the right of the state to exercise diplomatic protection for the benefit of its nationals and the duty to re admit them to its territory for the individual_ duties associated with being national may include the performance of military service or the payment of taxes_ while the rights include the right to enter_ reside in and leave the territory of the state of nationality_ the right to consular assistance and the right to vote diplomatic and consular protection case law of the international court of justice icj diplomatic protection has long been regarded as an exclusive right of the state because the individual_ in the early years of international law_ had no place in the international legal order or any associated rights see draft articles on diplomatic protection adopted by the international law commission in with commentaries_ commentary on article and to cite the mavrommatis judgment of the permanent court of international justice by taking up the case of one of its subjects and by resorting to diplomatic action or international judicial proceedings on his behalf_ state is in reality asserting its own rights its right to ensure_ in the person of its subjects_ respect for the rules of international law the icj subsequently took account of the evolution of international law concerning the international legal personality of the individual in its judgment in ahmadou sadio diallo republic of guinea democratic republic of the congo preliminary objections judgment of may the icj observed as follows the court will recall that under customary international law_ as reflected in article of the draft articles on diplomatic protection of the international law commission hereinafter the ilc diplomatic protection consists of the invocation by state_ through diplomatic action or other means of peaceful settlement_ of the responsibility of another state for an injury caused by an internationally wrongful act of that state to natural or legal person that is national of the former state with view to the implementation of such responsibility article of the draft articles on diplomatic protection adopted by the ilc at its fifty eighth session ilc report_ doc owing to the substantive development of international law over recent decades in respect of the rights it accords to individuals_ the scope ratione materiae of diplomatic protection_ originally limited to alleged violations of the minimum standard of treatment of aliens_ has subsequently widened to include_ inter alia_ internationally guaranteed human rights in the barcelona traction case_ the icj took the view that the exercise of diplomatic protection was discretionary power of the state of nationality belgium spain_ judgment of february the court would here observe that_ within the limits prescribed by international law_ state may exercise diplomatic protection by whatever means and to whatever extent it thinks fit_ for it is its own right that the state is asserting should the natural or legal persons on whose behalf it is acting consider that their rights are not adequately protected_ they have no remedy in international law all they can do is to resort to municipal law_ if means are available_ with view to furthering their cause or obtaining redress the municipal legislator may lay upon the state an obligation to protect its citizens abroad_ and may also confer upon the national right to demand the performance of that obligation_ and clothe the right with corresponding sanctions however_ all these questions remain within the province of municipal law and do not affect the position internationally the state must be viewed as the sole judge to decide whether its protection will be granted_ to what extent it is granted_ and when it will cease it retains in this respect discretionary power the exercise of which may be determined by considerations of political or other nature_ unrelated to the particular case since the claim of the state is not identical with that of the individual or corporate person whose cause is espoused_ the state enjoys complete freedom of action whatever the reasons for any change of attitude_ the fact cannot in itself constitute justification for the exercise of diplomatic protection by another government_ unless there is some independent and otherwise valid ground for that international law commission ilc draft articles on diplomatic protection article of the draft articles on diplomatic protection_ as adopted by the ilc in confirms that the state has no obligation or duty to exercise diplomatic protection on behalf of its nationals it reads state has the right to exercise diplomatic protection in accordance with the present draft articles article of the draft articles reads recommended practice state entitled to exercise diplomatic protection according to the present draft articles should give due consideration to the possibility of exercising diplomatic protection_ especially when significant injury has occurred in its commentary to article the ilc explains as follows footnotes omitted there are certain practices on the part of states in the field of diplomatic protection which have not yet acquired the status of customary rules and which are not susceptible to transformation into rules of law in the exercise of progressive development of law nevertheless they are desirable practices_ constituting necessary features of diplomatic protection that add strength to diplomatic protection as means for the protection of human rights the discretionary nature of the state right to exercise diplomatic protection is affirmed by draft article of the present draft articles and has been asserted by the international court of justice and national courts_ as shown in the commentary to draft article despite this there is growing support for the view that there is some obligation_ however imperfect_ on states_ either under international law or national law_ to protect their nationals abroad when they are subjected to significant human rights violations the constitutions of many states recognize the right of the individual to receive diplomatic protection for injuries suffered abroad_ which must carry with it the corresponding duty of the state to exercise protection moreover_ number of national court decisions indicate that although state has discretion whether to exercise diplomatic protection or not_ there is an obligation on that state_ subject to judicial review_ to do something to assist its nationals_ which may include an obligation to give due consideration to the possibility of exercising diplomatic protection on behalf of national who has suffered significant injury abroad if customary international law has not yet reached this stage of development then draft article subparagraph must be seen as an exercise in progressive development consular assistance and protection under article of the vienna convention_ consular functions include protecting in the receiving state the interests of the sending state and of its nationals_ both individuals and bodies corporate_ within the limits permitted by international law and helping and assisting

human rights instruments article of the universal declaration of human rights_ december provides that veryone has the right to leave any country_ including his own_ and to return to his country article of the american convention on human rights provides that one can be expelled from the territory of the state of which he is national or be deprived of the right to enter it article of the african charter on human and peoples rights provides every individual shall have the right to leave any country including his own_ and to return to his country this right may only be subject to restrictions_ provided for by law for the protection of national security_ law and order_ public health or morality the international covenant on civil and political rights iccpr was adopted in by the united nations general assembly and ratified by france on november articles and read as follows article each state party to the present covenant undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the present covenant article everyone lawfully within the territory of state shall_ within that territory_ have the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence everyone shall be free to leave any country_ including his own the above mentioned rights shall not be subject to any restrictions except those which are provided by law_ are necessary to protect national security_ public order ordre public public health or morals or the rights and freedoms of others_ and are consistent with the other rights recognized in the present covenant no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of the right to enter his own country in its general comment no on the freedom of movement under article of the iccpr_ adopted on november un documents ccpr rev add the united nations human rights committee unccpr stated as follows freedom to leave any country_ including one own paragraph in order to enable the individual to enjoy the rights guaranteed by article paragraph obligations are imposed both on the state of residence and on the state of nationality since international travel usually requires appropriate documents_ in particular passport_ the right to leave country must include the right to obtain the necessary travel documents the issuing of passports is normally incumbent on the state of nationality of the individual the refusal by state to issue passport or prolong its validity for national residing abroad may deprive this person of the right to leave the country of residence and to travel elsewhere it is no justification for the state to claim that its national would be able to return to its territory without passport the right to enter one own country paragraph the right of person to enter his or her own country recognizes the special relationship of person to that country the right has various facets it implies the right to remain in one own country it includes not only the right to return after having left one own country it may also entitle person to come to the country for the first time if he or she was born outside the country if that country is the person state of nationality the right to return is of the utmost importance for refugees seeking voluntary repatriation it also implies prohibition of enforced population transfers or mass expulsions to other countries the wording of article paragraph does not distinguish between nationals and aliens no one thus_ the persons entitled to exercise this right can be identified only by interpreting the meaning of the phrase his own country the scope of his own country is broader than the concept country of his nationality it is not limited to nationality in formal sense_ that is_ nationality acquired at birth or by conferral it embraces_ at the very least_ an individual who_ because of his or her special ties to or claims in relation to given country_ cannot be considered to be mere alien this would be the case_ for example_ of nationals of country who have there been stripped of their nationality in violation of international law and of individuals whose country of nationality has been incorporated into or transferred to another national entity whose nationality is being denied them the language of article paragraph moreover_ permits broader interpretation that might embrace other categories of long term residents_ including but not limited to stateless persons arbitrarily deprived of the right to acquire the nationality of the country of such residence since other factors may in certain circumstances result in the establishment of close and enduring connections between person and country_ states parties should include in their reports information on the rights of permanent residents to return to their country of residence in no case may person be arbitrarily deprived of the right to enter his or her own country the reference to the concept of arbitrariness in this context is intended to emphasize that it applies to all state action_ legislative_ administrative_ and judicial it guarantees that even interference provided for by law should be in accordance with the provisions_ aims and objectives of the covenant and should be_ in any event_ reasonable in the particular circumstances the committee considers that there are few_ if any_ circumstances in which deprivation of the right to enter one own country could be reasonable state party must not_ by stripping person of nationality or by expelling an individual to third country_ arbitrarily prevent this person from returning to his or her own country in the case of vidal martins uruguay communication no march the unccpr stated the issue of passport to uruguayan citizen is clearly matter within the jurisdiction of the uruguayan authorities and he is subject to the jurisdiction of uruguay for that purpose moreover_ passport is means of enabling him to leave any country_ including his own as required by article of the covenant it therefore follows from the very nature of the right that_ in the case of citizen resident abroad it imposes obligations both on the state of residence and on the state of nationality consequently_ article of the covenant cannot be interpreted as limiting the obligations of uruguay under article to citizens within its own territory in mukong cameroon communication july it found finally_ as to the claim under article paragraph the committee notes that the author was not forced into exile by the state party authorities in the summer of but left the country voluntarily_ and that no laws or regulations or state practice prevented him from returning to cameroon as the author himself concedes_ he was able to return to his country in april even if it may be that his return was made possible_ or facilitated_ by diplomatic intervention_ this does not change the committee conclusion that there has been no violation of article paragraph in this case in jiménez vaca colombia communication march the unccpr found onsidering the committee view that the right to security of person art para was violated and that there were no effective domestic remedies allowing the author to return from involuntary exile in safety_ the committee concludes that the state party has not ensured to the author his right to remain in_ return to and reside in his own country paragraphs and of article of the covenant were therefore violated this violation necessarily has negative impact on the author enjoyment of the other rights ensured under the covenant in accordance with article paragraph of the covenant_ the state party is under an obligation to provide mr luis asdrúbal jiménez vaca with an effective remedy_ including compensation_ and to take appropriate measures to protect his security of person and his life so as to allow him to return to the country in the case of deepan budlakoti canada communication no april the unccpr found as follows the notion of arbitrariness includes elements of injustice_ lack of predictability and due process of law_ as well as elements of reasonableness_ necessity and proportionality here are few_ if any_ circumstances in which deprivation of the right to enter one own country could be reasonable state party must not_ by stripping person of nationality or by expelling an individual to third country_ arbitrarily prevent this person from returning to his or her own country in the case of communidad moiwana community suriname judgment of june series no the inter american court of human rights ruled as follows on the right to enter one own country as guaranteed by article of the american convention on human rights_ of part of the moiwana community suriname nationals forcibly exiled to french guiana after an armed attack thus_ the state has failed to both establish conditions_ as well as provide the means_ that would allow the moiwana community members to return voluntarily_ in safety and with dignity_ to their traditional lands_ in relation to which they have special dependency and attachment as there is objectively no guarantee that their human rights_ particularly their rights to life and to personal integrity_ will be secure by not providing such elements including_ foremost_ an effective criminal investigation to end the reigning impunity for the attack suriname has failed to ensure the rights of the moiwana survivors to move freely within the state and to choose their place of residence furthermore_ the state has effectively deprived those community members still exiled in french guiana of their rights to enter their country and to remain there united nations convention on the rights of the child the international convention on the rights of the child crc adopted on november and ratified by almost all the member states of the united nations_ seeks to secure and protect the specific rights of children_ extending to children the concept of human

legislative and administrative measures the joint general comment no of the committee on the protection of the rights of all migrant workers and members of their families and no of the committee on the rights of the child cmw gc crc gc reads as follows the obligations of states parties under the conventions apply to each child within their jurisdictions_ including the jurisdiction arising from state exercising effective control outside its borders those obligations cannot be arbitrarily and unilaterally curtailed either by excluding zones or areas from the territory of state or by defining particular zones or areas as not or only partly under the jurisdiction of the state_ including in international waters or other transit zones where states put in place migration control mechanisms the obligations apply within the borders of the state_ including with respect to those children who come under its jurisdiction while attempting to enter its territory in decisions of november and february crc crc crc the committee on the rights of the child declared admissible several communications concerning requests for the repatriation to france of children of french nationality_ whose parents had allegedly collaborated with isil and who were being held in the roj_ ain issa and al hol camps the authors of the communications alleged that the french government had not taken the measures necessary to repatriate the children to france and_ by its inaction_ was violating several articles of the crc articles and see paragraph above together with articles and and right to life_ protection against all forms of ill treatment_ special protection of children in the context of deprivation of their family environment_ access to medical care_ and protection from cruel_ inhuman and degrading punishment or treatment and from unlawful detention the committee found that france exercised jurisdiction over the children decision of february footnotes omitted for the following reasons the committee must determine if the state party has competence ratione personae over the children detained in the camps in north eastern syrian arab republic the committee recalls that_ under the convention_ states have the obligation to respect and ensure the rights of the children within their jurisdiction_ but the convention does not limit state jurisdiction to territory state may also have jurisdiction in respect of acts that are performed_ or that produce effects_ outside its national borders in the migration context_ the committee has held that under the convention_ states should take responsibility for the protection of children who are their nationals outside their territory through child sensitive_ rights based consular protection in its decision on belgium_ the committee considered that belgium had jurisdiction to ensure the rights of child located in morocco who had been separated from belgian moroccan couple that had taken her in under the kafalah system in the present case_ the committee notes that it is uncontested that the state party was informed by the authors of the situation of extreme vulnerability of the children_ who were detained in refugee camps in conflict zone detention conditions have been internationally reported as deplorable and have been brought to the attention of the state party authorities through the various complaints filed by the authors at the national level the detention conditions pose an imminent risk of irreparable harm to the children lives_ their physical and mental integrity and their development the committee recognizes that the effective control over the camps was held by non state actor that had made it publicly known that it did not have the means or the will to care for the children and women detained in the camps and that it expected the detainees countries of nationality to repatriate them the committee also notes that the independent international commission of inquiry on the syrian arab republic has recommended that countries of origin of foreign fighters take immediate steps towards repatriating such children as soon as possible in the circumstances of the present case_ the committee observes that the state party_ as the state of the children nationality_ has the capability and the power to protect the rights of the children in question by taking action to repatriate them or provide other consular responses these circumstances include the state party rapport with the kurdish authorities_ the latter willingness to cooperate and the fact that the state party has already repatriated at least french children from the camps in syrian kurdistan since march in light of the above_ the committee concludes that the state party does exercise jurisdiction over the children in decision of february the committee ruled on the merits of the above mentioned communications it found that the fact that the state party had not protected the child victims constitute violation of their rights under articles and of the crc see paragraph above and the failure of the state party to protect the child victims against an imminent and foreseeable threat to their lives

states_ while acknowledging that it was complicated_ to repatriate children with eu citizenship relevant provisions of international humanitarian law ihl the syrian conflict is generally characterised as non international armed conflict to which article common to the four geneva conventions is applicable this provision is binding on non state armed groups such as the sdf see international committee of the red cross_ commentary on the first geneva convention_ article paragraph it requires humane treatment for all persons who are not directly participating in the hostilities or who have been disarmed it specifically prohibits_ in all places and at all times_ violence to life and person and outrages upon personal dignity_ in particular humiliating and degrading treatment article and it requires that the wounded and sick be collected and cared for article paragraph see also paragraphs et seq of above cited commentary on the fundamental obligations under article the geneva conventions contain common article under which the high contracting parties undertake to respect and to ensure respect for the convention and its protocols in all circumstances in its advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of wall in the occupied palestinian territory of july the icj emphasised that every state party to that convention_ whether or not it is party to specific conflict_ is under an obligation to ensure that the requirements of the instruments in question are complied with the nature of the obligation to ensure respect for ihl has not been expressly defined to date according to the commentary on article this obligation also has an external dimension states_ whether neutral_ allied or enemy_ must do everything reasonably in their power to ensure respect for the conventions by others that are party to conflict paragraph this entails negative obligation_ not to encourage_ nor aid or assist in violations of the conventions by parties to conflict and positive obligation_ to do everything reasonably in their power to prevent and bring such violations to an end paragraph under rule of the study on customary international humanitarian law by the international committee of the red cross states may not encourage violations of international humanitarian law by parties to an armed conflict they must exert their influence_ to the degree possible_ to stop violations of international humanitarian law the commentary on this provision explains that state practice shows an overwhelming use of diplomatic protest and collective measures through which states exert their influence to try and stop violations of international humanitarian law it refers to publication in which other possible measures to ensure respect for ihl are enumerated_ including political pressure_ coercive measures_ measures taken in cooperation with international organisations and contributions to humanitarian actions council of work on protocol no and explanatory report ets no article of protocol no headed prohibition of expulsion of nationals prohibits the expulsion of an individual from the territory of which he or she is national paragraph and guarantees the right to enter that state paragraph it is indicated as follows in the collected edition of the travaux préparatoires of protocol no strasbourg_ the draft protocol adds to the list of rights protected by the convention and existing protocol certain civil and political rights not yet included_ but whose recognition is proposed in the draft international covenant concerning civil and political rights these rights are prohibition of arbitrary exile and the right to enter one own country article para of the draft covenant as regards the first paragraph of article the explanatory report to protocol no ets no the explanatory report indicates that the prohibition concerns the expulsion of nationals_ the term expulsion_ to be understood here in the generic meaning_ in current use to drive away from place having been preferred to exile which was open to various difficulties of interpretation explanatory report_ the preparatory work shows that the prohibition of exile was supposed to be absolute in the council of europe framework_ unlike the wider un context_ and that the same was therefore true of the right to enter one country_ as the possibility of exile not being arbitrary was not admitted see collected edition of the travaux préparatoires of protocol no cited above_ the explanatory report stated that article did not prohibit extradition it was also understood that an individual could not invoke this paragraph in order to avoid certain obligations such as obligations concerning military service ibid the report shows that it had been proposed_ by the committee of experts responsible for drafting the protocol_ to insert provision to the effect that state would be forbidden to deprive national of his nationality for the purpose of expelling him_ but it had been thought inadvisable to touch on the delicate question of the legitimacy of measures depriving individuals of nationality ibid proposal to replace the words state of which he is national in paragraphs and by his own country had not been accepted_ because the former expression had more precise legal meaning ibid and to avoid confusion between the exile of nationals and the expulsion of aliens see collected edition of the travaux préparatoires of protocol no cited above_ pp as regards the second paragraph_ the explanatory report reads as follows the committee made two amendments to the text proposed by the assembly the first amendment concerns the words everyone shall be free to which were replaced by no one shall be deprived of the right to this phrase was suggested by the wording of article paragraph of the draft international covenant adopted by the third committee of the united nations general assembly this wording seemed better solution than the other to matter of twofold concern to the committee on the one hand_ paragraph should not relieve persons who wish to enter the territory of the state of which they were nationals_ of the obligation to prove their nationality if so required state is not obliged to admit an individual who claims to be national unless he can make good his claim on the other hand_ such temporary measures as quarantine should not be interpreted as refusal of entry the second change is purely drafting one the expression enter the territory of the state was found preferable to enter the state the committee considered that this paragraph should not contain the word arbitrarily which appears in article paragraph of the united nations draft it was understood_ however_ that an individual right to enter the territory of the state of which he was national could not be interpreted as conferring on him an absolute right to remain in that territory for example_ criminal who_ having been extradited by the state of which he was national_ then escaped from prison in the other state_ would not have an unconditional right to seek refuge in his own country similarly_ soldier serving on the territory of state other than that of which he is national_ would not have right to repatriation in order to remain in his own country the committee agreed that the terms of paragraph could be invoked only in relation to the state of which the victim of any violation of this provision was national material from the council of europe parliamentary assembly and committee of ministers pace and cm the relevant passages of pace recommendation entitled international obligations concerning the repatriation of children from war and conflict zones adopted on january reads as follows the assembly stresses the gravity of the situation of children in syria and iraq whose parents_

centres insufficient food_ shelter from the elements_ access to clean water_ medical services and education exposure to violence_ abuse_ trafficking and exploitation and high rates of illness and mortality the assembly considers that the human rights based approach of the council of europe is essential for effectively combating terrorism abandoning the children stranded in syria and iraq_ in zones characterised by war_ conflict and their aftermath_ leaves these children exposed to grave violations of their rights as well as the risk of radicalisation their repatriation_ recovery and re integration is an investment in building prosperous and resilient societies in this urgent situation_ the assembly calls on the committee of ministers to ensure that council of europe action against terrorism_ when dealing with child related issues_ is focused on the best interest of the child_ in the reply to recommendation adopted by the committee of ministers on december at the st meeting of the ministers deputies the cm shared pace concerns about the situation of the children who should prima facie be considered as victims in resolution also adopted on january pace was convinced that actively repatriating_ rehabilitating and re integrating the children detained in camps in iraq and syria were human rights obligations and humanitarian duty and that it also constituted an essential contribution towards the national security of the countries concerned it thus urged states to take all necessary measures to ensure immediate repatriation of all children whose parents_ believed to be affiliated to daesh_ were citizens of their state to repatriate children together with their mothers or primary care givers_ unless it was not in the best interests of the child to provide urgent assistance to all children in the camps and to raise public awareness of the situation of the children concerned_ with view to alleviating public concerns related to national security in declaration adopted on march the pace committee on social affairs_ health and sustainable development took the view that the member states were able to exercise their jurisdiction over the syrian camps and must ensure that these european children in syria and iraq are treated and protected in accordance with international commitments it stated that pace had moral responsibility to ensure that these children were not forgotten and called on member states to deploy_ as matter of urgency_ the necessary means to return them european union lawconsular protection of eu citizens pursuant to article and article

of action of eu member states and the absence of coordination at eu level in its resolution on the syrian conflict ten years after the uprising rsp adopted on march the european parliament said that

netherlands_ norway_ the russian federation_ türkiye and the united kingdom these states have varied approaches the domestic courts dealing with this issue have taken the view that international law and international humanitarian law personal jurisdiction_ consular protection_ right to enter the state of nationality_ humanitarian assistance do not create an obligation for states to repatriate their nationals however_ some courts have held that their domestic law secures right to return to children and persons in situations of extreme distress_ although this must be assessed in the light of the wide margin of appreciation of states in matters of national security and the conduct of international relations on november the higher administrative court of berlin brandenburg upheld decision ordering the national authorities to grant consular protection to woman and her three minor children held in al hol camp and to repatriate them it took into account the dire humanitarian situation in the camp and based its decision on the rights to respect for life and physical integrity guaranteed by the basic law combined with the state duty deriving from these rights to provide protection it stated that the right to such protection would be breached if the authorities did not take any measures or if the measures they did take were manifestly inadequate to achieve this objective of protection it also stated that the children should be repatriated with their mother_ and that the right to enter the national territory guaranteed by article of protocol no might imply that the state should issue travel documents to the persons seeking return in similar cases_ however_ the same court has rejected requests for the return of women and children detained in roj camp on the grounds that their lives or physical integrity were not threatened in the camp in several first instance decisions of the belgian courts considered that article of the consular code_ guaranteeing consular assistance to persons in situations of extreme distress_ created subjective right of protection for children they took into account the unilateral commitment made by the belgian government in to repatriate children under the age of ten for children over that age_ they indicated that the belgian state must take into account the best interests of the child when exercising its discretion under the consular code they also ordered the repatriation of the mothers of these minors_ in spite of the fact that article of the consular code excluded persons who had travelled to region of armed conflict from any protection_ on the grounds of the best interests of the child and the right to respect for family life however_ those first instance decisions were overturned on appeal ruling on an application for the return of twenty three women held with their children in al hol and roj camps_ the dutch civil courts_ and ultimately the supreme court_ in judgment of june held that the state might owe duty of care to the children_ who were not responsible for the situation in which they found themselves_ given the deplorable living conditions in the camps as regards their mothers_ the courts considered that it was up to the local kurdish authorities to decide whether their return with their children was desirable however_ the courts found that the state had not exceeded its wide margin of appreciation by failing to actively pursue the repatriation of the women and children the hague court of appeal thus stated that civil court should show considerable degree of deference towards the balancing by the state of national security interests on the one hand against the applicants interests on the other it was only entitled to assess policy in cases where the state had not reached its decision in reasonable manner furthermore_ in judgment of january the rotterdam regional court ordered the dutch authorities to take all necessary measures to ensure that the arrest warrant issued for woman held in ain issa camp was brought to the attention of the local authorities so that she could be transferred to iraqi kurdistan_ taken into the care of the dutch consular authorities there and transferred to the netherlands to stand trial this woman was repatriated with her child decisions to repatriate have also been taken by bosnia and herzegovina_ denmark_ finland and norway these states_ together with belgium_ germany_ the netherlands and russia_ have organised repatriations and continue to do so see on this point the intervention by the clinique des droits de

 SANCHEZ-SANCHEZ v. THE UNITED KINGDOM,the factsthe circumstances of the case the applicant_ who was born in is currently detained in hmp wandsworth he was arrested in the united kingdom on april pursuant to request from the us according to information provided by the us department of justice_ he was believed to have been the joint head of mexico based drug trafficking organisation who supervised and managed the work of us based conspirators to distribute drugs in atlanta_ georgia the extradition request related to the following four offences conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana_ heroin and fentanyl maximum sentence of life imprisonment_ with mandatory minimum sentence of twenty years imprisonment aiding and abetting the possession with intent to distribute marijuana maximum sentence of life imprisonment_ with mandatory minimum sentence of ten years imprisonment aiding and abetting the possession with intent to distribute heroin and fentanyl maximum sentence of life imprisonment_ with mandatory minimum sentence of twenty years imprisonment conspiracy to import marijuana_ heroin and fentanyl in to the us maximum sentence of life imprisonment_ with mandatory minimum sentence of ten years imprisonment these charges arose from the shipment of kilograms of marijuana to warehouse in atlanta_ georgia_ which was seized in january and the seizure of fourteen kilograms of fentanyl laced heroin and about grams of fentanyl from an apartment in sandy springs_ georgia which was used by the conspirators to store drugs and money the first charge on the indictment indicated that co conspirator had died as result of using the fentanyl according to the us department of justice_ as far as the us is aware the applicant has no prior convictions the extradition hearing was conducted before the district judge on january government of the united states of america ismael sanchez sanchez the applicant argued that his extradition would breach his rights under article of the convention due to the conditions of pre trial and any post conviction detention_ and because there was real risk that he would be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole the district judge did not consider that the applicant had established real risk of breach of article as result of the conditions of pre trial or post conviction detention in respect of his complaint concerning the risk of life sentence without parole_ the applicant relied on trabelsi belgium_ no echr see paragraph below the district judge_ however_ considered herself bound by the domestic decision in harkins secretary of state for the home department ewhc admin see paragraphs below which had fully analysed all the authorities_ including trabelsi according to harkins the mere imposition of life sentence on an adult offender was not contrary to article of the convention provided that the sentence was not grossly the issue was whether it was irreducible an irreducible life sentence might raise an issue under article of the convention_ but that article would be satisfied where national law afforded the possibility of review_ with view to commutation_ remission_ terminal or conditional release of prisoner it was for the state to decide how review mechanism operated_ so long as the terms were sufficiently clear to the prisoner at the outset an article issue would only arise when it could be shown that continued imprisonment could no longer be justified on any legitimate penological grounds such as punishment_ deterrence_ public protection or rehabilitation or the sentence was irreducible de facto and de jure in harkins the court had interpreted vinter and others the united kingdom gc nos and others_ echr extracts as meaning that if at the outset mandatory life sentence was grossly or irreducible then the prisoner was not obliged to serve an indeterminate number of years before complaining that the sentence was not article compliant as for the likelihood that the applicant would receive life sentence without parole_ the parties agreed that the starting point for determining any sentence would be the us sentencing guidelines there were various factors for court to consider in determining whether to sentence within or below the sentencing range the guidelines were therefore advisory only the district judge_ having regard to the evidence before the court_ noted that in of the sentences handed out by the us courts were below the recommended range in the sentencing guidelines_ and life sentences were imposed in only of cases life sentences were rare in drug trafficking cases_ having been imposed in fewer than one third of drug trafficking cases in and as of january only of federal sentenced offenders in the federal bureau of prisons were serving de facto sentences of life imprisonment the district judge referred to the evidence of the assistant united states attorney_ who stated that the applicant was unlikely to receive life sentence on any count_ and it was less likely that he would receive consecutive sentences he was therefore likely to receive sentence that provided for his release before his death there would be number of opportunities to seek leniency or reduced sentence_ for example by pleading guilty_ and even if he were sentenced to life without parole us law provided for opportunities to seek reduction in sentence these included statutory right of appeal_ an application for executive clemency_ and request for compassionate release the applicant expert_ an experienced us lawyer_ agreed that the applicant was likely to receive concurrent rather than consecutive sentences however_ he pointed out that according to february report by the us sentencing commission_ entitled life sentences in the federal system there was usually requirement that someone had died as result of the crime before life sentence was imposed as there was an allegation that one of the applicant co conspirators died as result of fentanyl overdose_ it was more likely that the prosecution would request life sentence on the facts of the case at hand_ the district judge found that if the applicant were convicted_ his sentencing level would be level in the us sentencing guidelines_ which has sentence range of life imprisonment it was not possible to determine what sentence he would receive if convicted_ although he was likely to receive concurrent rather than consecutive sentences_ if convicted of more than one offence the sentencing process gave discretion to the sentencing judge and the sentencing guidelines were not the only relevant factor the applicant would also have the right to make representations to the judge nonetheless_ given the alleged offences_ including the fact that one of the applicant co conspirators had died from fentanyl overdose_ there was real possibility that the applicant would receive sentence of life imprisonment this sentence would not be grossly given the alleged offending and the us sentencing process the district judge did not take into account the possible reduction of sentence due to guilty plea or provision of assistance or information to the us authorities the district judge held that any sentence of life imprisonment would not be irreducible the applicant could apply for presidential pardon or for compassionate release the system had been assessed in shaw usa ewhc admin and was sufficiently clear therefore_ the applicant had failed to show that there was real risk of breach of his convention rights due to his likely sentence if he were convicted on february the district judge sent the case to the secretary of state for decision to be taken on whether to order extradition on april the secretary of state ordered the applicant extradition the applicant appeal was heard by the high court on february sanchez government of the united states of america ewhc with regard to his reliance on trabelsi_ the high court considered itself bound by the decision of the house of lords in wellington secretary of state for the home department ac see paragraphs below to hold that to extradite claimant to the us to face_ if convicted_ life sentence without parole_ would not breach article of the convention in wellington see paragraphs below the majority of the house of lords had concluded that_ in an extradition context_ article applied in modified form which took account of the desirability of arrangements for extradition the sentence of life imprisonment without parole was not so grossly so as to infringe article in the extradition context in any event_ the high court held that it would follow harkins see paragraphs below and hafeez united states of america ewhc admin see paragraphs below it did not consider itself bound to follow trabelsi which_ in light of the reasoning in harkins and hafeez_ was an unexplained departure from the court approach in harkins and edwards the united kingdom_ nos and january see paragraph below like the high court in harkins and hafeez_ it considered that following trabelsi there had been no clear and consistent jurisprudence from the court about the application of article to sentences of life imprisonment without parole in the extradition context the high court was also satisfied that life sentence would not be irreducible in hafeez see paragraphs below the court had described two routes by which prisoner could seek reduction in sentence under the us system compassionate release_ pursuant to title of the us code_ and executive clemency the high court also rejected the applicant second ground of appeal_ which concerned the conditions of pre trial and post conviction detention the applicant appeal was therefore dismissed and the court of appeal declined to certify point of law of general public importance relevant legal framework and practicethe united kingdomrelevant legislation under section of the extradition act the act the appropriate judge_ on considering request for extradition_ must decide whether the requested person extradition would be compatible with his or her convention rights within the meaning of the human rights act the act under section of the act_ if the judge decides this question in the negative he or she must order the person discharge if the judge decides that question in the affirmative then_ pursuant to section of the act_ he or she must send the case to the secretary of state for decision on whether the person is to be extradited according to section of the act the right of appeal against this decision is to the high court pursuant to section of the act_ it is unlawful for public authority to act in way which is incompatible with convention right public authority_ under section of the act_ includes any court or tribunal furthermore_ pursuant to section of the act_ person who claims that public authority has acted or proposes to act in way which is incompatible with the convention may rely on the convention provisions in any legal proceedings relevant case law wellington secretary of state for the home department ukhl the us requested the extradition of ralston wellington from the united kingdom to stand trial in missouri on two counts of murder in the first degree in his appeal against extradition_ mr wellington argued that his surrender would violate article of the convention_ on the basis that there was real risk that he would be subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment in the form of sentence of life imprisonment without parole in giving judgment in the high court ewhc admin lord justice laws found that there were powerful arguments of penal philosophy which suggested that risk of whole life sentence without parole intrinsically violated article of the convention since the supposed inalienable value of the prisoner life is reduced_ merely_ to his survival to nothing more than his drawing breath and being kept_ no doubt_ confined in decent circumstances however_ and not without misgivings he considered that the relevant authorities_ including those of this court_ suggested an irreducible life sentence would not always raise an article issue mr wellington appeal from that judgment was heard by the house of lords and dismissed on december relying on soering the united kingdom july series no majority of their lordships lord hoffmann_ baroness hale and lord carswell found that in the extradition context_ distinction had to be drawn between torture and lesser forms of ill treatment when there was real risk of torture_ the prohibition on extradition was absolute and left no room for balancing exercise however_ insofar as article applied to inhuman and degrading treatment and not to torture_ it was applicable only in relativist form to extradition cases for lord hoffmann_ paragraph of soering made clear that the desirability of extradition is factor to be taken into account in deciding whether the punishment likely to be imposed in the receiving state attains the minimum level of severity which would make it inhuman and degrading punishment which counts as inhuman and degrading in the domestic context will not necessarily be so regarded when the extradition factor has been taken into account he went on to state relativist approach to the scope of article seems to me essential if extradition is to continue to function for example_ the court of session has decided in napier scottish ministers sc that in scotland the practice of slopping out requiring prisoner to use chamber pot in his cell and empty it in the morning may cause an infringement of article whether_ even in domestic context_ this attains the necessary level of severity is point on which would wish to reserve my opinion if_ however_ it were applied in the context of extradition_ it would prevent anyone being extradited to many countries_ poorer than scotland_ where people who are not in prison often have to make do without flush lavatories minority of their lordships lord scott and lord brown disagreed with these conclusions they considered that the extradition context was irrelevant to the determination of whether whole life sentence amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment if no one could be expelled if he would then face the risk of torture_ so too no one could be expelled if he would then face the risk of treatment or punishment which was properly to be characterised as inhuman or degrading if mandatory life sentence violated article in domestic case_ the risk of such sentence would preclude extradition to another country however_ despite these different views_ none of the law lords found that the sentence likely to be imposed on mr wellington would be irreducible having regard to the commutation powers of the governor of missouri_ it would be just as reducible as the sentence at issue in kafkaris cyprus gc no echr all five law lords also noted that_ in kafkaris_ the court had only said that the imposition of an irreducible life sentence might raise an issue under article they found that the imposition of whole life sentence would not constitute inhuman and degrading treatment in violation of article per se_ unless it were grossly or clearly lord brown in particular noted having puzzled long over this question_ have finally concluded that the majority of the grand chamber in kafkaris would not regard even an irreducible life sentence by which_ as explained_ understand the majority to mean mandatory life sentence to be served in full without there ever being proper consideration of the individual circumstances of the defendant case as violating article unless and until the time comes when further imprisonment would no longer be justified on any ground whether for reasons of punishment_ deterrence or public protection it is for that reason that the majority say only that article may be engaged lord brown added that this test had not been met in wellington case_ particularly when the facts of the murders for which he was accused_ if committed in the united kingdom_ could have justified whole life order finally_ lord hoffmann_ lord scott_ baroness hale and lord brown all expressed doubts about lord justice laws views on penal philosophy in particular_ lord scott rejected the view that an irreducible life sentence was inhuman and degrading because it denied prisoner the possibility of atonement once it was accepted that whole life sentence could be just punishment_ atonement was achieved by the prisoner serving his sentence harkins sshd ewhc admin mr harkins was facing extradition to florida having been accused of killing man during an attempted armed robbery he faced mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole in january the chamber_ in harkins and edwards the united kingdom nos and january found that the applicant extradition would not breach his rights under article such sentence would not be grossly and mr harkins had not demonstrated that there was real risk of treatment reaching the article threshold as result of his sentence were he to be extradited in this regard_ he had not shown that_ if convicted_ his incarceration would serve no penological purpose_ so no article issue could arise at that time if time was reached when his incarceration could be shown not to serve any legitimate penological purpose_ it was still less certain that the governor of florida and board of executive clemency would refuse to avail themselves of their powers to commute his sentence mr harkins subsequently made further representations to the secretary of state_ which were rejected on january on june he issued an application to judicially review the secretary of state decision after the grand chamber judgment in vinter and others cited above on july he substituted his judicial review grounds with submission that the grand chamber judgment had radically changed the law on article so that his extradition_ in circumstances where he faced risk of mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole_ would violate that article he sought to rely on expert evidence to the effect that there was virtually no prospect of release at all in cases where life sentence without possibility of parole was imposed by court in the state of florida and_ in any event_ there was no dedicated review mechanism that accorded with the criteria laid down in vinter and others the high court held hearing on and july and reserved judgment on september the high court was informed that the court had given judgment in trabelsi cited above after considering written submissions on the relevance of trabelsi_ the high court held further hearing on october on november the high court refused permission to re open proceedings in the article claim the court identified two principal issues_ namely the basis on which proceedings could be re opened and whether the court decisions in vinter and others and trabelsi_ cited above_ had recast convention law to such an extent that the applicant extradition would result in violation of article in relation to the first issue_ the high court accepted that if there had been change in the law such as fundamentally to affect the human rights of an applicant_ that could_ in sufficiently exceptional circumstances_ give grounds for reopening case that has already been determined with respect to the second issue_ the high court decided that it was necessary to consider_ inter alia_ whether vinter and others had changed the law on article in relation to mandatory sentences of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole in the domestic context and ii the state of the law on article in the extradition context first_ the high court held that in vinter and others the grand chamber had not changed convention law on article in the domestic context in particular_ it had not changed the position that life sentences could be imposed on adult offenders for very serious offences and_ provided that the sentence was not_ by itself_ grossly the relevant issue was whether it was irreducible in respect of irreducible sentences_ the grand chamber had reiterated the position stated in kafkaris_ namely_ that an irreducible life sentence only may raise an issue under article and_ in determining whether life sentence is irreducible article will be satisfied if national law afforded the possibility of review with view to its commutation_ remission_ termination or the conditional release of the prisoner the high court accepted that in vinter and others the grand chamber had seemingly put the position more firmly when it stated that article must be interpreted as requiring reducibility of the sentence vinter and others_ cited above_ and that where domestic law does not provide for review whole life sentence will not measure up to the standards of article vinter and others_ cited above_ however_ the grand chamber had decided that it was not for it to prescribe the form of such review or whether it should be executive or judicial whilst the grand chamber had noted the clear support in international law for dedicated reviewing mechanism guaranteeing review after no more than twenty five years_ it did not make such mechanism requirement furthermore_ the high court understood paragraph of vinter and others to mean that if sentence was grossly or had no mechanism for review_ prisoner could challenge it under article from the outset of his imprisonment harkins and edwards was not inconsistent with that conclusion because it had only set out the point in time at which the actual violation would occur_ namely once continued imprisonment could no longer be justified on any legitimate penological grounds finally_ the high court decided that the requirement for review or mechanism and for the prisoner to know at the outset of his sentence what he must do to be considered for release and under what conditions_ and when the review might be sought_ was not revolutionary it was inherent in the notion of reducibility and implicit in the grand chamber decision in kafkaris furthermore_ it had done nothing more than invert the statement in harkins and edwards that an article issue would only arise when it could be shown that there was no longer penological justification for imprisonment and the sentence was irreducible de facto and de jure_ since logically the requirement must be that prisoner should know that he has to satisfy the relevant authority doing the review that his continued imprisonment can no longer be justified on penological grounds the precise details of how he was to do this and the terms of the detailed criteria were for the individual state to decide_ so long as those terms were sufficiently clear from the outset secondly_ on the issue of extradition_ the high court observed that harkins and edwards was_ at least prior to trabelsi_ the leading case in harkins and edwards the court had departed from soering to the extent that it had decided that the reason for expulsion could not be weighed against the risk of ill treatment when considering whether expulsion would violate article the court had also clarified that in extradition cases no distinction could easily be drawn between torture and other forms of ill treatment the court had therefore rejected the house of lords approach in wellington however_ it had accepted relativist approach to the extent that treatment that might violate article in domestic context might not reach the minimum level of severity to do so in the extradition context the tests of gross and reducibility therefore remained as for the domestic context_ subject to two important qualifications convention standards could not be imposed on non contracting states_ and as there were legitimate differences of approach to sentencing in different states_ there was no absolute standard on whether sentence was contrary to article or not the high court then considered trabelsi cited above it noted that the court had re affirmed that an irreducible life sentence only may raise an issue under article furthermore_ it had reiterated the finding in kafkaris cited above that possibility of review was sufficient for compliance with article the court had therefore set out no new principles in relation to article and extradition in applying the relevant principles_ the court in trabelsi had decided that the us authorities assurances on the possibility of sentence reduction were not sufficiently precise the high court considered that such conclusion was contrary to all the court previous statements about extradition and article and was difficult to reconcile with the grand chamber conclusion in vinter and others that it should not prescribe the form of review consequently_ the high court decided that the court decision did not develop the principles set out in vinter and others_ except insofar as it purported to lift and apply them to extradition although it appeared that the court itself considered vinter and others to have further developed the principles established in kafkaris_ the high court declined to agree hafeez united states wlr mr hafeez was facing extradition to the us he argued that his extradition would breach his rights under article of the convention because there was real risk that he would be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole the judge considered the possibility that the applicant might be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole mr hafeez had relied on trabelsi cited above however_ the judge rejected his article challenge on this ground as he found that if he was sentenced to life imprisonment he would be able to make an application for compassionate release if there were extraordinary and compelling circumstances warranting reduction in his sentence in doing so_ he indicated that having considered the detailed submissions made_ am satisfied that when life sentence is imposed_ the provisions of article will be satisfied in domestic context if it is de jure and de facto reducible see kafkaris cyprus_ no ii the relevant national law affords the possibility of review of life sentence with view to its commutation_ remission_ termination or the conditional release of the prisoner per vinter aforesaid and iii there is prospect of release and possibility of review which exist from the imposition of the sentence see murray above on january the district judge_ being satisfied that all of the procedural requirements were met_ and that none of the statutory bars to extradition applied_ sent the case to the secretary of state for decision to be taken on whether to order extradition mr hafeez appeal was heard by the high court in december and judgment was handed down on january with regard to his reliance on trabelsi_ the court declined to consider whether the evidence established that there was real risk the applicant_ if convicted_ would receive sentence of life imprisonment it did note that this outcome was by no means certain and pointed out that the us government had provided evidence from the us sentencing commission which indicated that life sentences were rare in the federal system the court accepted that if mr hafeez did receive life sentence_ there would be no provision for parole he would therefore only have two routes to obtain reduction or commutation of his sentence an application for compassionate release or petition for executive clemency for the former_ the applicant would have to show that extraordinary and compelling reasons existed which would warrant reduction of his sentence the sentencing commission had identified four scenarios which would fulfil the definition of extraordinary and compelling terminal illness the prisoner was over and experiencing serious deterioration in his health due to the ageing process and change in family circumstances leading to the prisoner becoming the only available caregiver for child or spouse the final scenario was left undefined save that it was expressly stated that rehabilitation was not by itself an extraordinary and compelling reason rehabilitation could_ however_ be relevant factor even though it could not by itself serve to reduce the sentence executive clemency_ on the other hand_ was described as an extraordinary remedy and evidence indicated that judicial review of clemency decision was very rare and certainly not routine the court then addressed the court case law on the issue of life sentences without parole it noted that in harkins secretary of state for the home department no wlr the divisional court had declined to follow trabelsi cited above since it considered that in that case the court had ignored the basic principle set out in kafkaris and vinter and others namely_ that state choice of specific criminal justice system_ including sentence review and release arrangements_ was in principle outside the scope of the court supervision_ provided that the chosen system did not contravene the principles set out in the convention secondly_ in harkins the divisional court had indicated that even if detailed consideration of the review scheme in the us had been appropriate_ on this issue the judgment in trabelsi had been wholly unreasoned the high court agreed with this analysis it therefore found that trabelsi was not of assistance since insofar as it purports to reach concluded view on the compatibility of life imprisonment without parole in the united states_ it does so without any proper reasoning insofar as it departs from the established echr jurisprudence on the application of article in relation to removal to non contracting state_ we prefer the rationale as set out in harkins and edwards uk it further rejected mr hafeez submission that any review scheme had to permit release purely by reason of the prisoner rehabilitative efforts in light of this assessment_ the court held that there would be no risk of violation of article of the convention on account of the possibility that mr hafeez would be sentenced to life imprisonment since any prisoner so sentenced would have two routes to seek reduction of that sentence compassionate release and executive clemency his appeal was therefore dismissed the united states of principles the core sentencing principles under us law are found in title united states code factors to be considered in imposing sentence the court shall impose sentence sufficient_ but not greater than necessary_ to comply with the purposes set forth in paragraph of this subsection the court_ in determining the particular sentence to be imposed_ shall consider the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense_ to promote respect for the law_ and to provide just punishment for the offense to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant and to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training_ medical care_ or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner the kinds of sentences available the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established for the applicable category of offense committed by the applicable category of defendant as set forth in the guidelines issued by the sentencing commission pursuant to section of title united states code_ subject to any amendments made to such guidelines by act of congress regardless of whether such amendments have yet to be incorporated by the sentencing commission into amendments issued under section of title and ii that_ except as provided in section are in effect on the date the defendant is sentenced or in the case of violation of probation or supervised release_ the applicable guidelines or policy statements issued by the sentencing commission pursuant to section of title united states code_ taking into account any amendments made to such guidelines or policy statements by act of congress regardless of whether such amendments have yet to be incorporated by the sentencing commission into amendments issued under section of title any pertinent policy statement issued by the sentencing commission pursuant to section of title united states code_ subject to any amendments made to such policy statement by act of congress regardless of whether such amendments have yet to be incorporated by the sentencing commission into amendments issued under section of title and that_ except as provided in section is in effect on the date the defendant is sentenced the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct and the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense executive clemency the basis for commutation of sentence pursuant to executive clemency is found in article ii of the us constitution_ which empowers the president to grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the united states_ except in cases of impeachment guidance published by the us department of justice reads as follows commutation of sentence is an extraordinary remedy appropriate grounds for considering commutation have traditionally included disparity or undue severity of sentence_ critical illness or old age and meritorious service rendered to the government by the petitioner cooperation with investigative or prosecutive efforts that has not been adequately rewarded by other official action combination of these and or other equitable factors such as demonstrated rehabilitation whilst in custody or exigent circumstances unforeseen by the court at the time of sentencing may also provide basis for recommending commutation in the context of particular case compassionate release pursuant to title courts are authorised to reduce defendant term of imprisonment based on extraordinary and compelling reasons when considering any motion under title commonly referred to as compassionate release motions the court must find_ after considering the factors set forth in that extraordinary and compelling reasons warrant such reduction and that any reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the sentencing commission before december courts were authorised to consider motions under title only if they were filed by the director of the bureau of prisons in december congress amended that portion of to authorise courts to also consider motions filed by offenders_ in certain circumstances section of the first step act amended title to authorise defendants to file motion for compassionate release after the defendant has fully exhausted all administrative rights to appeal failure of the bureau of prisons to bring motion on the defendant behalf or the lapse of days from the receipt of such request by the warden of the defendant facility_ whichever is earlier according to policy statement issued by the us sentencing commission_ extraordinary and compelling reasons exist under any of the circumstances set forth below the defendant is suffering from terminal illness serious and advanced illness with an end of life trajectory ii the defendant is suffering from serious physical or medical condition_ suffering from serious functional or cognitive impairment_ or experiencing deteriorating physical or mental health because of the aging process_ that substantially diminishes his ability to provide self care within the environment of correctional facility and from which he or she is not expected to recover iii the defendant is at least years old is experiencing serious deterioration in physical or mental health because of the aging process and has served at least years or percent of his or her term of imprisonment_ whichever is less iv the death or incapacitation of the caregiver of the defendant minor child or minor children the incapacitation of the defendant spouse or registered partner when the defendant would be the only available caregiver for the spouse or registered partner vi there exists in the defendant case an extraordinary and compelling reason other than_ or in combination with_ the reasons described above pursuant to title rehabilitation of the defendant is not_ by itself_ an extraordinary and compelling reason for purposes of this policy statement statistical information concerning the imposition of life sentences in the federal system report by the us sentencing commission_ entitled life sentences in the federal system february this report by the us sentencing commission provided_ insofar as relevant life imprisonment sentences are rare in the federal criminal justice system virtually all offenders convicted of federal crime are released from prison eventually and return to society or_ in the case of illegal aliens_ are deported to their country of origin yet in fiscal year federal judges imposed sentence of life imprisonment without parole on offenders another offenders received sentence of specific term of years that was so long it had the practical effect of being life sentence although together these offenders represent only percent of all offenders sentenced that year_ this type of sentence sets them apart from the rest of the offender population the united states sentencing commission promulgates federal sentencing guidelines that provide advisory sentencing ranges which judges are required to consider when imposing sentence in federal felony cases the guidelines take into account both offense behavior and offender characteristics to provide recommended range of imprisonment_ probation_ or some combination of confinement and probation the drug trafficking guidelines specifically provide for sentence of life imprisonment for drug trafficking offenses_ but only where death or serious bodily injury resulted from the use of the drug and the defendant had been convicted previously of drug trafficking offense in some other drug trafficking cases_ such as those involving very large quantities of drugs and where the offender has significant prior criminal history_ the sentencing range can include life imprisonment_ although only as the sanction at the top of the range life imprisonment sentences were imposed in variety of types of cases in fiscal year but were most common in drug trafficking_ firearms_ murder_ and extortion and racketeering cases in virtually all of these cases_ one or more persons died as result of the criminal enterprise offenses for which life imprisonment sentence was imposedthe most common offense type for which life imprisonment sentence was imposed in fiscal year was drug trafficking cases these cases accounted for percent of all life imprisonment sentences that year even so_ life sentence is rare in drug trafficking cases_ having been imposed in less than one third of one percent of all drug trafficking cases that year as discussed above_ the sentencing guidelines call for life imprisonment sentence in drug trafficking offenses when death or serious bodily injury resulted from the use of the drug and when the offender had one or more prior convictions for drug trafficking but life imprisonment sentence can also be imposed in other drug trafficking cases

applicants_ milena_ obrad and dejan dragojevic_ were born in and respectively_ and applied to the court on behalf of dragorad dragojevic_ deceased son of milena and obrad dragojevic and brother of dejan dragojevic the applicants lodged the present application to complain of the outcome of an action in damages which they had brought in the italian courts in respect of an air strike against the fry background and the bombing of radio televizija srbija rts the facts of the case relate to the same events as those considered by the court in its decision in the case of banković and others belgium and others dec gc no echr xii the facts in that case were summarised as follows the conflict in kosovo between serbian and kosovar albanian forces during and is well documented against the background of the escalating conflict_ together with the growing concerns and unsuccessful diplomatic initiatives of the international community_ the six nation contact group established in by the london conference met and agreed to convene negotiations between the parties to the conflict on january and following decision of its north atlantic council nac the north atlantic treaty organisation nato announced air strikes on the territory of the fry in the case of non compliance with the demands of the international community negotiations consequently took place between the parties to the conflict from to february in rambouillet and from to march in paris the resulting proposed peace agreement was signed by the kosovar albanian delegation but not by the serbian delegation considering that all efforts to achieve negotiated political solution to the kosovo crisis had failed_ the nac decided on_ and on march the secretary general of nato announced_ the beginning of air strikes operation allied force against the fry the air strikes lasted from march to june three television channels and four radio stations operated from the rts facilities in belgrade the main production facilities were housed in three buildings at takovska street the master control room was housed on the first floor of one of the buildings and was staffed mainly by technical staff on april just after approximately_ one of the rts buildings at takovska street was hit by missile launched from nato forces aircraft two of the four floors of the building collapsed and the master control room was destroyed twenty four targets were hit in the fry that night_ including three in belgrade the partial collapse of the rts building caused the deaths of sixteen people_ including the five relatives of the applicants civil proceedings in the rome district court on may the first four applicants brought an action in damages in the rome district court under article of the italian civil code the other six applicants applied to be joined to the proceedings on november the applicants believed that civil liability for the deaths of their relatives lay with the italian prime minister office and ministry of defence and with the command of nato allied forces in southern europe afsouth they argued that the italian courts had jurisdiction to hear the case in particular_ on the basis of the wording of article of the italian criminal code_ they submitted that the unlawful act that had caused the alleged damage should be regarded as having been committed in italy inasmuch as the military action had been organised on italian territory and part of it had taken place there they based this argument on the extent of italy commitment involving substantial political and logistical support to the military mission in question specifically_ italy_ unlike other nato members_ had provided the air bases from which the aircraft that had bombed belgrade and the rts had taken off they also relied in support of their claim on article of the wartime military criminal code and on the london convention of and the protocol additional to the geneva conventions the defendants argued that the italian courts had no jurisdiction to hear the case the proceedings against afsouth were discontinued by the applicants the prime minister office and the ministry of defence subsequently sought preliminary ruling from the court of cassation on the question of jurisdiction regolamento preventivo di giurisdizione under article of the italian code of civil procedure in written submissions dated november assistant principal state counsel at the court of cassation argued that the application for preliminary ruling should be declared inadmissible as it concerned the merits of the claim_ not the issue of jurisdiction he stated as follows the governmental bodies defending this claim have requested preliminary ruling on the issue of jurisdiction_ arguing that since the action is brought against the italian state as specific unitary subject of international law for acts performed in the exercise of its imperium iure imperii it cannot be brought in the italian courts paragraph of article viii of the london convention of june which italy ratified by law no of does not provide any basis for the action either_ as it applies to damage caused in the receiving state the government seek to show through this jurisdictional issue that the italian legal system does not contain any provision or principle capable of providing basis for the alleged personal right diritto soggettivo perfetto or of guaranteeing it in the abstract accordingly_ the position is that the government argue that the italian state cannot be held liable for acts carried out in the exercise of its imperium in addition_ they deny that the said london convention can be used to determine the place where the acts which caused the alleged damage took place it is not by accident that the applicant has cited the provisions of the criminal code referring to the place where the offence was committed it follows that the questions thus raised go to the merits_ not to the issue of jurisdiction see judgment no of december of the court of cassation_ sitting as full court for these reasons_ the court of cassation_ sitting as full court_ is asked to declare the application inadmissible_ with all the consequences which that entails in law in ruling no of february which was deposited with the registry on june and conveyed to the applicants on june the court of cassation_ sitting as full court sezioni unite found that the italian courts had no jurisdiction it reasoned as follows the claim seeks to impute liability to the italian state on the basis of an act of war_ in particular the conduct of hostilities through aerial warfare the choice of the means that will be used to conduct hostilities is an act of government these are acts through which political functions are performed and the constitution provides for them to be assigned to constitutional body the nature of such functions precludes any claim to protected interest in relation thereto_ so that the acts by which they are carried out may or may not have specific content see the judgments of the full court of july no october no and january no with respect to acts of this type_ no court has the power to review the manner in which the function was performed while the purpose of the provisions of international agreements governing the conduct of hostilities the protocol additional to the geneva conventions articles and and the european convention on human rights articles and is to protect civilians in the event of attack_ they are rules of international law_ and so also regulate relations between states these same treaties lay down the procedure for finding violation and the sanctions in the event of liability article of the protocol and article of the convention they also designate the international courts and tribunals with jurisdiction to make such finding however_ the legislation implementing these rules in the italian state does not contain any express provision enabling injured parties to seek reparation from the state for damage sustained as result of violation of the rules of international law the notion that provisions to that effect may implicitly have been introduced into the system through the implementation of rules of international law is at odds with the converse principle that has been mentioned which holds that protected individual interests are no bar to carrying out functions of political nature indeed_ in order to enable reparation to be provided in the domestic system for loss sustained as result of violation of the reasonable time requirement under article of the convention on human rights_ the state introduced appropriate legislation law no of march no entitlement to review of the government decision concerning the conduct of hostilities with respect to the nato aerial operations against the federal republic of yugoslavia can be found in the london convention of the fact that the aircraft used to bomb the belgrade radio and television station were able to use bases situated on italian territory constitutes but one element of the highly complex operation whose lawfulness it is sought to review and is not therefore relevant to the application of the rule laid down in paragraph of article viii of the convention_ which on the contrary presupposes the commission of an act that is amenable to review the court of cassation ruling brought to an end_ ipso jure_ the proceedings in the rome district court ii relevant domestic law and practice the relevant provisions of the italian constitution are as follows article the italian legal system shall comply with the generally recognised rules of international law article everyone may bring legal proceedings to protect his or her rights and legitimate interests article civil servants_ other agents of the state and public entities shall be directly responsible_ in accordance with the criminal_ civil and administrative law_ for acts committed in breach of rights in connection with such acts_ civil liability shall extend to the state and public entities article judicial protection of rights and legitimate interests in the ordinary and administrative courts shall always lie against acts of the public administrative authorities it may not be excluded or limited to extraordinary remedies or specific categories of act the law shall specify which judicial bodies are empowered to set aside acts of the public authorities_ in what cases and with what effects article of royal decree no of june provides no appeal to the consiglio di stato_ sitting in its judicial capacity_ shall lie against acts or decisions of the government which involve the exercise of political power article of the civil code provides any unlawful act which causes damage to another will render the perpetrator liable in damages under the civil law article of the code of civil procedure_ which deals with the issue of jurisdiction_ provides for so long as there has been no determination of the merits of the proceedings at first instance_ any party may seek ruling on question of jurisdiction under article from the court of cassation_ sitting as full court article of the code of civil procedure provides ruling that an ordinary court has no jurisdiction because the case concerns public authority or is within the province of special court may be made at any time and at any level of jurisdiction_ including by the court of its own motion the relevant provisions of the criminal code provide article anyone who commits an offence on the territory of the state shall be punished in accordance with italian law the offence will be regarded as having been committed on the territory of the state if all or part of the act or omission at the origin of the offence or all or some of the consequences of such act or omission occurred there article restitution and compensation for damage the commission of an offence shall give rise to an obligation of restitution under the civil law articles et seq of the civil code any offence that causes pecuniary damage article of the civil code or non pecuniary damage article of the civil code shall impose an obligation on the perpetrator and those accountable for his or her actions under the civil law article of the civil code to make reparation article of the wartime military criminal code reads as follows commanding officer of military force who_ in order to inflict damage on the enemy_ orders or authorises the use of means or method of warfare that is prohibited by law or by international treaty or which is in any event contrary to the military code of honour shall be liable on conviction to minimum of five years imprisonment unless the act concerned is criminal offence under specific statutory provision if the act results in massacre_ the minimum term of imprisonment shall be ten years in judgment of july no the court of cassation_ sitting as full court_ established the rule that the courts had no jurisdiction to hear cases against the authorities relating to political acts trade union had brought an action against the prime minister_ the civil service ministry and the ministry of state education on the ground that the government had failed to comply with their undertakings the court of cassation noted_ inter alia_ that such failure could only engage the government political responsibility_ but could not create right it ruled that the courts had no jurisdiction to hear the case after formulating the following principle legislative action is political act since it is the standard means of performing political and governmental functions the governmental authority conduct in the present case was not_ therefore_ capable in law of causing individuals damage whether to their personal rights or to their legitimate interests it consequently escapes all judicial scrutiny the italian courts had in fact already examined this question in number of earlier cases and had ruled that_ as they were political in nature_ the following acts escaped the scrutiny of the domestic courts waiver of the right to exercise jurisdiction under article vii of the agreement of between the parties to the north atlantic treaty

lazio regional administrative court january no pestalozza the treasury_ trib amm reg regional administrative court review the full court of the court of cassation delivered further judgment no on march it concerned the jurisdiction of the italian civil courts to hear claims for compensation for damage sustained by person who had been captured by the german military in and deported to work for german industry germany had pleaded state immunity and the courts of first instance and appeal had held that they had no jurisdiction to make an order against it the court of cassation carried out very extensive examination of the international treaties on international crime_ the international responsibility of states_ immunity from jurisdiction and of the case law of various international tribunals in holding that the immunity plea failed and the italian courts had to decide the claim_ it stated inter alia in decision no of june this full court did indeed rule that acts performed by the state in the conduct of hostilities escape all scrutiny by the courts_ as they are acts through which political functions are carried out the nature of these functions precludes any claim to protected interest in respect thereto_ so that there may or may not be specific content to the acts through which they are performed pursuant to this principle_ the italian courts were held to have no jurisdiction to hear claim against the italian prime minister office and the italian ministry of defence for compensation for the destruction of non military objective during nato air strikes against the federal republic of yugoslavia or for the resultant civilian deaths it is readily apparent_ however_ firstly_ that the fact that the court cannot contest the manner in which the actions of the supreme head of the res publica are conducted does not prevent it from finding that criminal offence has been committed or that there is related liability under the criminal or civil law articles and of the constitution section of constitutional law no of and section of law no of secondly_ by virtue of the principle of adaptation established by article of the constitution_ the generally recognised principles of international law which govern the fundamental values constituted by the freedom and dignity of the human being and characterise the most serious assaults upon the integrity of those values as international crimes have automatically been integrated into our system and are entirely apt for use as standard whereby the injustice of damage caused to others by intentional or negligent acts may be gauged it is evident_ therefore_ that the principles referred to in this decision cannot be taken into consideration in the instant case granting immunity from jurisdiction to states who have been guilty of such wrongdoing is in manifest contradiction with the aforementioned normative rules because it constitutes an obstacle to the defence of values whose protection_ like these norms and principles_ must on the contrary be considered essential for the entire international community_ even to the point of justifying forms of mandatory response in the most serious cases nor is there any doubt that the antinomy must be resolved by giving priority to the highest ranking norms_ as the judges in the minority eight to nine stated in their dissenting opinion appended to the judgment in al adsani the united kingdom gc no echr xi by precluding in such cases any claim by the state to immunity from suit in the foreign courts in the italian government decided to send military expeditionary force to somalia to perform peacekeeping operations after the expeditionary force had returned to italy_ it was discovered that some of its members had engaged in the torture of somali prisoners two members of the expedition were charged and given prison sentences they were also ordered to pay compensation to the civil party in judgment no of march the text of which was deposited with the registry on july the rome civil court ordered another italian serviceman and the ministry of defence to make reparation for the damage sustained by the relatives of civilian whom the serviceman had killed unlawfully iii other relevant provisions the applicants relied in the domestic courts on the protocol additional of june to the geneva conventions of august relating to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts protocol the protocol_ which italy ratified through law no of december contains_ inter alia_ the following provisions article basic rules in any armed conflict_ the right of the parties to the conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited it is prohibited to employ weapons_ projectiles and material and methods of warfare of

acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited civilians shall enjoy the protection afforded by this section_ unless and for such time as they take direct part in hostilities indiscriminate attacks are prohibited indiscriminate attacks are those which are not directed at specific military objective those which employ method

detained under schedules and to the act pending their removal or deportation the courts in the united kingdom have ruled that this power of detention can only be exercised during the period necessary_ in all the circumstances of the particular case_ to effect removal and that_ if it becomes clear that removal is not going to be possible within reasonable time_ detention will be unlawful governor of durham prison_ ex parte singh all er article of the conventionit is well established that article permits the detention of person with view to deportation only in circumstances where action is being taken with view to deportation chahal the united kingdom ehrr at paragraph in that case the european court of human rights indicated that detention will cease to be permissible under article if deportation proceedings are not prosecuted with due diligence and that it was necessary in such cases to determine whether the duration of the deportation proceedings was excessive paragraph in some cases_ where the intention remains to remove or deport person on national security grounds_ continued detention may not be consistent with article as interpreted by the court in the chahal case this may be the case_ for example_ if the person has established that removal to their own country might result in treatment contrary to article of the convention in such circumstances_ irrespective of the gravity of the threat to national security posed by the person concerned_ it is well established that article prevents removal or deportation to place where there is real risk that the person will suffer treatment contrary to that article if no alternative destination is immediately available then removal or deportation may not_ for the time being_ be possible even though the ultimate intention remains to remove or deport the person once satisfactory arrangements can be made in addition_ it may not be possible to prosecute the person for criminal offence given the strict rules on the admissibility of evidence in the criminal justice system of the united kingdom and the high standard of proof required derogation under article of the conventionthe government has considered whether the exercise of the extended power to detain contained in the anti terrorism_ crime and security act may be inconsistent with the obligations under article of the convention as indicated above_ there may be cases where_ notwithstanding continuing intention to remove or deport person who is being detained_ it is not possible to say that action is being taken with view to deportation within the meaning of article as interpreted by the court in the chahal case to the extent_ therefore_ that the exercise of the extended power may be inconsistent with the united kingdom obligations under article the government has decided to avail itself of the right of derogation conferred by article of the convention and will continue to do so until further notice the derogation notice then set out the provisions of part of the anti terrorism_ crime and security bill on november the anti terrorism_ crime and security bill_ containing the clauses which were to eventually become part of the anti terrorism_ crime and security act the act see paragraph below was introduced into the house of commons the bill was passed by parliament in two weeks_ with three days of debate on the floor of the house of commons set aside for its clauses in restrictive programming motion_ prompting both the joint committee of human rights and the home affairs select committee to complain of the speed with which they were being asked to consider the matter the act came into force on december during the lifetime of the legislation_ sixteen individuals_ including the present eleven applicants_ were certified under section and detained the first six applicants were certified on december and taken into detention shortly thereafter the seventh applicant was certified and detained in early february the ninth applicant on april the eighth applicant on october the tenth applicant on january and the eleventh applicant was certified on october and kept in detention_ having previously been held under other legislation the derogation proceedings in proceedings before the special immigration appeals commission siac see paragraphs below the first seven applicants challenged the legality of the derogation_ claiming that their detention under the act was in breach of their rights under articles and of the convention each_ in addition_ challenged the secretary of state decision to certify him as an international terrorist on july having examined both open and closed material and heard submissions from special advocates in addition to counsel for the parties and for the third party_ liberty_ siac delivered its ruling on the legality of the derogation it held that_ on the basis of the open material_ it was satisfied that the threat from al qaeda had created public emergency threatening the life of the nation_ within the meaning of article of the convention_ and that the closed material confirmed this view siac further held that the fact that the objective of protecting the public from international terrorists could possibly have been achieved by alternative methods did not demonstrate that the measures actually adopted were not strictly necessary moreover_ since the purpose of the detention was the protection of the united kingdom_ the fact that the detainee was at liberty to leave demonstrated that the measures were properly tailored to the state of emergency siac rejected the applicants complaints under article of the convention it held that_ in so far as they related to conditions of detention_ the applicants should bring proceedings in the ordinary civil courts_ and that siac had no jurisdiction to determine such complaint as it was not derogation issue it further saw no merit in the applicants argument that detention for an indefinite period was contrary to article on this point_ siac held that the detention was not indefinite_ since it was governed by the time limits of the act itself and since the act provided that each applicant certification was subject to automatic review by siac every six months in any event_ the mere fact that no term had yet been fixed for preventive detention did not give rise to breach of article siac did not accept that article of the convention applied to the certification process the certification of each applicant as suspected international terrorist was not charge but instead statement of suspicion and the proceedings before siac were not for the determination of criminal charge furthermore_ there was no relevant civil right at issue and article did not apply in its civil limb either siac did_ however_ rule that the derogation was unlawful because the relevant provisions of the act unjustifiably discriminated against foreign nationals_ in breach of article of the convention the powers of the act could properly be confined to non nationals only if the threat stemmed exclusively_ or almost exclusively_ from non nationals and the evidence did not support that conclusion in paragraphs of its judgment_ siac held if there is to be an effective derogation from the right to liberty enshrined in article in respect of suspected international terrorists and we can see powerful arguments in favour of such derogation the derogation ought rationally to extend to all irremovable suspected international terrorists it would properly be confined to the alien section of the population only if_ as counsel for the appellants contends_ the threat stems exclusively or almost exclusively from that alien section but the evidence before us demonstrates beyond argument that the threat is not so confined there are many british nationals already identified mostly in detention abroad who fall within the definition of suspected international terrorists and it was clear from the submissions made to us that in the opinion of the secretary of state there are others at liberty in the united kingdom who could be similarly defined in those circumstances we fail to see how the derogation can be regarded as other than discriminatory on the grounds of national origin siac thus quashed the derogation order of november and issued declaration of incompatibility in respect of section of the act under section of the act see paragraph below it adjourned the first seven applicants individual appeals against certification see paragraphs below pending the outcome of the secretary of state appeal and the applicants cross appeal on points of law against the above ruling on october the court of appeal delivered its judgment and others secretary of state for the home department ewca civ it held that siac had been entitled to find that there was public emergency threatening the life of the nation however_ contrary to the view of siac_ it held that the approach adopted by the secretary of state could be objectively justified there was rational connection between the detention of non nationals who could not be deported because of fears for their safety_ and the purpose which the secretary of state wished to achieve_ which was to remove non nationals who posed threat to national security moreover_ the applicants would be detained for no longer than was necessary before they could be deported or until the emergency was resolved or they ceased to be threat to the country safety there was no discrimination contrary to article of the convention_ because british nationals suspected of being terrorists were not in an analogous situation to similarly suspected foreign nationals who could not be deported because of fears for their safety such foreign nationals did not have right to remain in the country but only right_ for the time being_ not to be removed for their own safety the court of appeal added that it was well established in international law that_ in some situations_ states could distinguish between nationals and non nationals_ especially in times of emergency it further concluded that parliament had been entitled to limit the measures proposed so as to affect only foreign nationals suspected of terrorist links because it was entitled to reach the conclusion that detention of only the limited class of foreign nationals with which the measures were concerned was_ in the circumstances_ strictly required within the meaning of article of the convention the court of appeal agreed with siac that the proceedings to appeal against certification were not criminal within the meaning of article of the convention it found_ however_ that the civil limb of article applied but that the proceedings were as fair as could reasonably be achieved it further held that the applicants had not demonstrated that their detention amounted to breach of article of the convention the applicants were granted leave to appeal to the house of lords_ which delivered its judgment on december ukhl majority of the law lords_ expressly or impliedly_ found that the applicants detention under part of the act did not fall within the exception to the general right of liberty set out in article of the convention see lord bingham_ at paragraphs lord hoffman_ at paragraph lord hope_ at paragraphs lord scott_ at paragraph lord rodger_ at paragraph baroness hale_ at paragraph lord bingham summarised the position in this way person who commits serious crime under the criminal law of this country may of course_ whether national or non national_ be charged_ tried and_ if convicted_ imprisoned but non national who faces the prospect of torture or inhuman treatment if returned to his own country_ and who cannot be deported to any third country_ and is not charged with any crime_ may not under article of the convention and schedule to the immigration act be detained here even if judged to be threat to national security the house of lords further held_ by eight to one lords bingham and scott with considerable hesitation that siac conclusion that there was public emergency threatening the life of the nation should not be displaced lord hope assessed the evidence as follows there is ample evidence within the open material to show that the government were fully justified in taking the view in november that there was an emergency threatening the life of the nation the united kingdom was at danger of attacks from the al qaeda network which had the capacity through its associates to inflict massive casualties and have devastating effect on the functioning of the nation this had been demonstrated by the events of september in new york_ pennsylvania and washington there was significant body of foreign nationals in the united kingdom who had the will and the capability of mounting coordinated attacks here which would be just as destructive to human life and to property there was ample intelligence to show that international terrorist organisations involved in recent attacks and in preparation for other attacks of terrorism had links with the united kingdom_ and that they and others posed continuing threat to this country there was growing body of evidence showing preparations made for the use of weapons of mass destruction in this campaign it was considered by the home office that the serious threats to the nation emanated predominantly_ albeit not exclusively_ and more immediately from the category of foreign nationals the picture which emerges clearly from these statements is of current state of emergency it is an emergency which is constituted by the threat that these attacks will be carried out it threatens the life of the nation because of the appalling consequences that would affect us all if they were to occur here but it cannot yet be said that these attacks are imminent on october the secretary of state said in the house of commons that there was no immediate intelligence pointing to specific threat to the united kingdom see hansard hc debates_ col on march this assessment of the position was repeated in the government response to the second report of the house of commons select committee on defence on the threat from terrorism hc para where it was stated that it would be wrong to say that there was evidence of particular threat would not conclude from the material which we have seen that there was no current emergency but would conclude that the emergency which the threats constitute is of different kind_ or on different level_ from that which would undoubtedly ensue if the threats were ever to materialise the evidence indicates that the latter emergency cannot yet be said to be imminent it has to be recognised that_ as the attacks are likely to come without warning_ it may not be possible to identify stage when they can be said to be imminent this is an important factor_ and do not leave it out of account but the fact is that the stage when the nation has to face that kind of emergency_ the emergency of imminent attack_ has not been reached lord hoffman_ who dissented_ accepted that there was credible evidence of threat of serious terrorist attack within the united kingdom_ but considered that it would not destroy the life of the nation_ since the threat was not so fundamental as to threaten our institutions of government or our existence as civil community he concluded that the real threat to the life of the nation comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these the other law lords lords bingham_ nicholls_ hope_ scott_ rodger_ carswell and baroness hale_ with lord walker dissenting rejected the government submission that it was for parliament and the executive_ rather than the courts_ to judge the response necessary to protect the security of the public lord bingham expressed his view as follows it follows from this analysis that the appellants are in my opinion entitled to invite the courts to review_ on proportionality grounds_ the derogation order and the compatibility with the convention of section of the act and the courts are not effectively precluded by any doctrine of deference from scrutinising the issues raised it also follows that do not accept the full breadth of the attorney general submissions do not in particular accept the distinction which he drew between democratic institutions and the courts it is of course true that the judges in this country are not elected and are not answerable to parliament it is also of course true that parliament_ the executive and the courts have different functions but the function of independent judges charged to interpret and apply the law is universally recognised as cardinal feature of the modern democratic state_ cornerstone of the rule of law itself the attorney general is fully entitled to insist on the proper limits of judicial authority_ but he is wrong to stigmatise judicial decision making as in some way undemocratic it is particularly inappropriate in case such as the present in which parliament has expressly legislated in section of the act to render unlawful any act of public authority_ including court_ incompatible with convention right has required courts in section to take account of relevant strasbourg jurisprudence has in section required courts_ so far as possible_ to give effect to convention rights and has conferred right of appeal on derogation issues the effect is not_ of course_ to override the sovereign legislative authority of the queen in parliament_ since if primary legislation is declared to be incompatible the validity of the legislation is unaffected section and the remedy lies with the appropriate minister section who is answerable to parliament the act gives the courts very specific_ wholly democratic_ mandate the majority therefore examined whether the detention regime under part of the act was proportionate response to the emergency situation_ and concluded that it did not rationally address the threat to security and was response to that threat they relied on three principal grounds firstly_ that the detention scheme applied only to non nationals suspected of international terrorism and did not address the threat which came from united kingdom nationals who were also so suspected secondly_ that it left suspected international terrorists at liberty to leave the united kingdom and continue their threatening activities abroad thirdly_ that the legislation was drafted too broadly_ so that it could_ in principle_ apply to individuals suspected of involvement with international terrorist organisations which did not fall within the scope of the derogation on the first point_ lord bingham emphasised that siac finding that the terrorist threat was not confined to non nationals had not been challenged since siac was the responsible fact finding tribunal_ it was unnecessary to examine the basis for its finding_ but there was evidence that upwards of thousand individuals from the uk are estimated on the basis of intelligence to have attended training camps in afghanistan in the last five years that some british citizens were said to have planned to return from afghanistan to the united kingdom and that the background material relating to the applicants showed the high level of involvement of british citizens and those otherwise connected with the united kingdom in the terrorist networks lord bingham continued it is plain that sections and of the act do not address the threat presented by uk nationals since they do not provide for the certification and detention of uk nationals it is beside the point that other sections of the act and the act do apply to uk nationals_ since they are not the subject of derogation_ are not the subject of complaint and apply equally to foreign nationals yet the threat from uk nationals_ if quantitatively smaller_ is not said to be qualitatively different from that from foreign nationals it is also plain that sections and do permit person certified and detained to leave the united kingdom and go to any other country willing to receive him_ as two of the appellants did when they left for morocco and france respectively such freedom to leave is wholly explicable in terms of immigration control if the british authorities wish to deport foreign national but cannot deport him to country because of chahal their purpose is as well served by his voluntary departure for country but allowing suspected international terrorist to leave our shores and depart to another country_ perhaps country as close as france_ there to pursue his criminal designs_ is hard to reconcile with belief in his capacity to inflict serious injury to the people and interests of this country the fifth step in the appellants argument permits of little elaboration but it seems reasonable to assume that those suspected international terrorists who are uk nationals are not simply ignored by the authorities when the fifth applicant was released from prison by siac on bail it was on condition among other things that he wear an electronic monitoring tag at all times that he remain at his premises at all times that he telephone named security company five times each day at specified times that he permit the company to install monitoring equipment at his premises that he limit entry to his premises to his family_ his solicitor_ his medical attendants and other approved persons that he make no contact with any other person that he have on his premises no computer equipment_ mobile telephone or other electronic communications device that he cancel the existing telephone link to his premises and that he install dedicated telephone link permitting contact only with the security company the appellants suggested that conditions of this kind_ strictly enforced_ would effectively inhibit terrorist activity it is hard to see why this would not be so in urging the fundamental importance of the right to personal freedom_ as the sixth step in their proportionality argument_ the appellants were able to draw on the long libertarian tradition of english law_ dating back to chapter of magna carta given effect in the ancient remedy of habeas corpus_ declared in the petition of right upheld in series of landmark decisions down the centuries and embodied in the substance and procedure of the law to our own day in its treatment of article of the european convention_ the european court also has recognised the prime importance of personal freedom the appellants proportionality challenge to the order and section is_ in my opinion_ sound_ for all the reasons they gave and also for those given by the european commissioner for human rights and the newton committee the attorney general could give no persuasive answer in addition_ the majority held that the act was discriminatory and inconsistent with article of the convention_ from which there had been no derogation the applicants were in comparable situation to united kingdom nationals suspected of being international terrorists_ with whom they shared the characteristics of being irremovable from the united kingdom and being considered threat to national security since the detention scheme was aimed primarily at the protection of the united kingdom from terrorist attack_ rather than immigration control_ there was no objective reason to treat the applicants differently on grounds of their nationality or immigration status although the applicants appeal had included complaints under articles and of the convention_ the house of lords did not consider it necessary to determine these complaints since it had found the derogation to be unlawful on other grounds it granted quashing order in respect of the derogation order_ and declaration under section of the act see paragraph below that section of the act was incompatible with articles and of the convention in so far as it was and permitted discriminatory detention of suspected international terrorists the certification proceedings the generic judgment and appeals meanwhile_ siac hearing of the applicants individual appeals against certification commenced in may after the court of appeal had given judgment in the derogation proceedings but before the above judgment of the house of lords for the purposes of each appeal to siac_ the secretary of state filed an open statement summarising the facts connected to the decision to certify each applicant and as much of the supporting evidence which the secretary of state considered could be disclosed without giving rise to any risk to national security further_ closed statement of facts and evidence was also placed before siac in each case on october siac issued generic judgment in which it made number of findings of general application to all the appeals against certification as regards preliminary issues_ it found_ inter alia_ that it had jurisdiction to hear an appeal against certification even where the person certified had left the united kingdom and the certificate had been revoked it held that the tests whether reasonable grounds existed for suspicion that person was terrorist and for belief that his presence in the united kingdom was risk to national security_ within the meaning of section of the act_ fell some way short of proof even on the balance of probabilities it further held that reasonable grounds could be based on material which would not be admissible in normal trial in court_ such as hearsay evidence of an unidentified informant the weight that was to be attached to any particular piece of evidence was matter for consideration in the light of all the evidence viewed as whole information which might have been obtained by torture should not automatically be excluded_ but the court should have regard to any evidence about the manner in which it was obtained and judge its weight and reliability accordingly siac held that the detention provisions in the act should be interpreted in the light of the terms of the derogation the threat to the life of the nation was not confined to activities within the united kingdom_ because the nation life included its diplomatic_ cultural and tourism related activities abroad moreover_ attacks on the united kingdom allies could also create risk to the united kingdom_ given the interdependence of countries facing global terrorist threat the derogation identified the threat as emanating from al qaeda and its associates it was therefore necessary_ in respect of both the national security and the international terrorist limbs of section of the act_ to show reasonable grounds for suspicion that the person certified was part of group which was connected_ directly or indirectly_ to al qaeda even if the main focus of the group in question was national struggle_ if it backed al qaeda for part of its agenda and the individual nonetheless supported the group_ it was legitimate inference that he was supporting and assisting al qaeda siac also made number of findings of fact of general application concerning organisations alleged by the secretary of state to be linked to al qaeda these findings were based on both open and closed material thus_ it held_ for example_ that the salafist group for call and combat gspc which was formed in algeria in was an international terrorist organisation linked to al qaeda through training and funding_ but that the earlier algerian organisation_ armed islamic group gia was not the egyptian islamic jihad eij was either part of al qaeda or very closely linked to it the chechen arab mujahaddin was an international terrorist group_ pursuing an anti west agenda beyond the struggle for chechen independence_ with close links to al qaeda siac also identified as falling within the terms of the derogation group of primarily algerian extremists centred around abu doha_ an algerian who had lived in the united kingdom from about it was alleged that abu doha had held senior role in training camps in afghanistan and had many contacts in al qaeda_ including connection with the frankfurt cell which had been accused of plotting to bomb the strasbourg christmas market in december abu doha was arrested in february following an extradition request from the united states of america_ but his group remained active the applicants appealed against siac ruling that evidence which might have been obtained by torture was admissible for the purposes of the appeal_ the parties agreed that the proceedings before siac to challenge certification fell within article of the convention and as such had to satisfy the basic requirements of fair trial it was not_ therefore_ necessary to decide whether article also applied and the issue was left open on august the court of appeal_ by majority_ upheld siac decision ewca civ on december the house of lords held unanimously that the evidence of suspect or witness which had been obtained by torture had long been regarded as inherently unreliable_ unfair_ offensive to ordinary standards of humanity and decency and incompatible with the principles on which courts should administer justice it followed that such evidence might not lawfully be admitted against party to proceedings in united kingdom court_ irrespective of where_ by whom and on whose authority the torture had been inflicted since the person challenging certification had only limited access to the material advanced against him in the proceedings before siac_ he could not be expected to do more than raise plausible reason that material might have been so obtained and it was then for siac to initiate the relevant enquiries the house of lords therefore allowed the applicants appeals and remitted each case to siac for reconsideration ukhl siac conclusions as regards each applicant case are set out in paragraphs below of the sixteen individuals_ including the eleven applicants_ detained under part of the act_ one had his certificate cancelled by siac the certification proceedings the individual determinations the first applicant the first applicant was born in palestinian refugee camp in jordan_ is stateless_ and was granted indefinite leave to remain in the united kingdom in on december the first applicant was certified by the secretary of state as suspected international terrorist under section of the act on december deportation order was made on the same grounds the first applicant was taken into detention on december he subsequently appealed to siac against certification and the decision to make deportation order on july he was transferred to broadmoor secure mental hospital the first applicant and his representatives were served with the secretary of state open material_ including police report which showed that large sums of money had moved through the four bank accounts in his name siac and the special advocate instructed on behalf of the first applicant were in addition presented with closed evidence assisted by an interpreter_ the first applicant gave oral evidence to siac and called one witness to testify to his good character he also filed four medical reports concerning his mental health siac observed in its judgment of october we are acutely aware that the open material relied on against the applicant is very general and that the case depends in the main upon assertions which are largely unsupported the central allegation is that he has been involved in fund raising and distribution of those funds for terrorist groups with links to al qaeda it is also said that he has procured false documents and helped facilitate the movement of jihad volunteers to training camps in afghanistan he is said to be closely involved with senior extremists and associates of osama bin laden both in the united kingdom and overseas his case is and always has been that he is concerned and concerned only with welfare projects_ in particular school in afghanistan for the children of arab speakers there and projects such as construction of wells and provision of food to communities in afghanistan he has also raised money for refugees from chechnya any contact with so called extremists has been in that context and he had no reason to believe they were terrorists or were interested in terrorism we recognise the real difficulties that the appellant has in making this appeal we have made appropriate allowance for those difficulties and his mental problems we note his counsel concerns that there has been gross by the security service of the situation which is_ he submits_ highly complex and tendency to assume that any devout muslim who believed that the way of life practised by the taliban in afghanistan was the true way to follow must be suspect we note_ too_ that initially the respondent asserted that all the appellant fund raising activities were for the purpose of assisting terrorism and that it was only when evidence was produced by the appellant to show that there were legitimate charitable objectives that he accepted that at least some money was raised for those purposes in so far as connections with named individuals are relied on_ we bear in mind that some of them_ who are alleged to be involved in terrorism_ have appeals pending and that allegations against others have not been tested nor have alleged links been able to be explained the first applicant counsel accepted_ as he had to_ the unreliability of the applicant evidence about his movements in the s_ but asked us not to hold it against him because of his mental state we do not accept that we can do that the lies were deliberate attempt to rebut the allegation that he had been mujahid in afghanistan_ saying that he spent three years in jordanian prison there was an overstatement by the police of the amount involved through the bank account this we accept_ but there was still substantial sum of money going through them and the applicant counsel submitted that the allegation was that he had provided false documents for others not for himself thus his false iraq passport was not material it does however show an ability to obtain false passport the applicant counsel attacked the reliability of the intelligence relied on against the appellant since it was only belatedly accepted that he had been involved in genuine charitable work and that some of the money going through his account and raised by him was for such purpose we recognise the danger that all activities by one who is under suspicion may be regarded as themselves suspicious and that there may not be fair consideration of all material to see whether it truly does support the suspicion we have considered all the material_ in particular that which is closed_ with that danger in mind as we have said_ the open evidence taken in isolation cannot provide the reasons why we are dismissing this appeal and we sympathise with the first applicant counsel concerns that he had most difficult task we were not impressed with the appellant as witness_ even making all allowances for his mental state and the difficulties under which he was labouring he was often evasive and vague and has admittedly told lies in relation to his movements in the his explanations about some of the transactions recorded in his bank accounts we have found difficult to follow or accept we should say that we do not consider that the respondent case is significantly advanced by what has been said about the appellant involvement with algeria or chechnya the case depends essentially on the evidence about the appellant dealings with afghanistan and with terrorists known to have links with al qaeda it is clear that the appellant was very successful fund raiser and_ more importantly_ that he was able to get the money to afghanistan whatever his problems_ he was able to and was relied on to provide an efficient service his explanations both of who were the well known terrorists whose children were at the school and of the various of the more substantial payments shown in the bank accounts are unsatisfactory he was vague where_ having regard to the allegations made against him_ we would have expected some detail we have considered all the evidence critically the closed material confirms our view that the certification in this case was correct there is both reasonable belief that the appellant presence in the united kingdom is risk to national security and reasonable suspicion that he is terrorist within the meaning of section of the act this appeal is accordingly dismissed in accordance with the terms of the act_ the first applicant case was reviewed by siac six months later in its judgment of july siac found that the updated open generic material continues to show that there is direct terrorist threat to the united kingdom from group or groups of largely north african islamic extremists_ linked in various ways to al qaeda although some of his contacts have been detained_ the range of extremists prominent in various groups was such that he would have no difficulty and retains the will and ability to add his considerable experience of logistic support to them in pursuit of the extremist islamic agenda in the uk the certificate is properly maintained siac reviewed the case again on december and again found that the certificate should be maintained the second applicant the second applicant is citizen of morocco born on february he entered the united kingdom as visitor in and was granted leave to remain as student on june he was granted indefinite leave to remain on the basis of his marriage to british citizen_ which subsequently broke down in and again in he applied for naturalisation_ but no decision was made on those applications in he remarried another british citizen_ with whom he has child on december the second applicant was certified by the secretary of state as suspected international terrorist under section of the act deportation order was made on the same date the second applicant was taken into detention on december he appealed against the certification and deportation order but_ nonetheless_ elected to leave the united kingdom for morocco on december he pursued his appeals from morocco in its judgment of october siac summarised the open case against the second applicant as follows he has links with both the gia and the gspc algerian terrorist groups see paragraph above and is close associate of number of islamic extremists with links to al qaeda and or bin laden he has been concerned in the preparation and or instigation of acts of international terrorism by procuring high tech equipment including communications equipment for the gspc and or islamic extremists in chechnya led by ibn khattab and has also procured clothing for the latter group he has supported one or more of the gia_ the gspc and the ibn khattab faction in chechnya by his involvement in fraud perpetrated to facilitate the funding of extremists and storing and handling of propaganda videos promoting the jihad the secretary of state open case expands on those allegations and further indicates the use of at least one alias and pattern of association with individuals known or assessed to be involved in terrorism five individuals were identified all these were described by counsel for the secretary of state as known algerian islamic extremists witness for the secretary of state confirmed that the allegation against the second applicant is that he is member of network_ rather than member of any particular organisation such as the gspc or the gia siac continued by explaining the findings it had made against the applicant like the other appellants_ the second applicant is not charged in these proceedings with series of individual offences the issue is whether_ taking the evidence as whole_ it is reasonable to suspect him of being an international terrorist as defined when we look at the material before us_ as we do_ we treat it cumulatively it might be that the material relating to fraud alone_ or to clothing alone_ or to videos alone_ or to associations_ would not by itself show that person was in any way involved in terrorism or its support but we need to assess the situation when various factors are found combined in the same person those factors are as follows first is his involvement in acts of fraud_ of which he must be aware but of which he seeks to provide no explanation_ excusing himself apparently on the ground that he is not aware which particular act or acts the secretary of state has in mind secondly_ he has been involved in raising consciousness and hence in raising money about the struggle in chechnya_ and has been doing so in specifically islamic rather than merely humanitarian context_ using and distributing films which_ according to the evidence before us_ tend to be found in extremist communities in the generic evidence_ we have dealt with the chechen arab mujahaddin and the significance of support for it which we accepted is given in full knowledge of its wider jihadist agenda he has done so as close associate of abu doha given the information we have about abu doha which_ as we have said_ we have no reason to doubt_ we regard the second applicant claim that abu doha was doing nothing illegal save that he was hiding his activities from the russians as entirely implausible he has had associations with number of other individuals involved in terrorism they are for the most part specified by name in the open case but are not mentioned in his own statement these are the five features which meet in the second applicant no doubt the secretary of state could have made his case by demonstrating various combinations of them in single person with all five_ we regard the case as compelling we are entirely satisfied that the secretary of state is reasonable in his suspicion that the second applicant supports or assists the gia_ the gspc_ and the looser group based around abu doha_ and in his belief that at any time the second applicant is in the united kingdom his presence here is risk to national security the third applicant the third applicant is of tunisian nationality_ born in and resident in the united kingdom from about he was certified by the secretary of state on december and detained the following day in its judgment of october dismissing the third applicant appeal against certification_ siac observed the case against the appellant_ as framed in the open material_ is that he is key member of an extreme islamist group known as the tunisia fighting group tfg it is said that this group was formed during and had its origins in the tunisian islamic front known as the fit since the name is in french its ultimate aim is said to be to establish an islamic state in tunisia it is further asserted that the appellant has been in regular contact with number of known extremists including some who have been involved in terrorist activities or planning both the fit and the tfg are said to have links with al qaeda the open material deployed against the appellant is not at all substantial the evidence which is relied on against him is largely to be found in the closed material this has meant that he has been at real disadvantage in dealing with the case because he is not aware of those with whom he is alleged to have been in contact in his statement the appellant says that he has never heard of the tfg and is certainly not member of it we have no doubts that the tfg exists and also that it has links to al qaeda our reasons for so concluding must be given in the closed judgment in may the appellant and some ten others were arrested in joint special branch and security service operation pursuant to warrants under the prevention of terrorism act the appellant was released without charge and in due course received compensation for wrongful arrest the arrests were in connection with allegations of involvement in plot to target the world cup in france we of course give weight to the absence of any admissible evidence to support the appellant involvement in the alleged conspiracy_ but it is not and cannot be the answer to this appeal we have to consider all the material to see whether there are reasonable grounds for belief or suspicion of the kind referred to in section or of the act we are satisfied that the appellant is member of the tfg_ itself an international terrorist organisation within the scope of the act_ and that he has links with an international terrorist group we appreciate that our open reasons for being so satisfied are sparse that is because the material which drives us to that conclusion is mainly closed we have considered it carefully and in the context of knowing the appellant denies any involvement in terrorism or any knowing support for or assistance to terrorists we have therefore been careful only to rely on material which cannot in our judgment have an innocent explanation siac reached similar conclusions in its periodic reviews of the case on july and on december the fourth applicant the fourth applicant was born in algeria in and first entered the united kingdom in in may he was arrested and charged with number of offences_ including conspiracy to export to algeria material which it was alleged was to be used for the purposes of terrorism it was alleged that he was member of gia the case against the applicant was abandoned in march when key witness_ security service agent_ who was to give evidence concerning the need for civilians to defend themselves against atrocities allegedly committed by the algerian government_ decided that it was too dangerous for him to give evidence in the fourth applicant married french national he became french citizen in may although he did not inform the united kingdom authorities of this the secretary of state certified him under section of the act on december and he was detained on december on march he left for france_ where he was interviewed on arrival by security officials and then set at liberty since he had left the united kingdom_ the certificate against him was revoked and the revocation was backdated to march in its judgment of october siac held that the backdating of the revocation meant that the fourth applicant could not be regarded as having been certified at the time he lodged his appeal and that_ therefore_ he had no right of appeal it nonetheless decided to consider the appeal on the basis that this conclusion might be wrong since the secretary of state could not reasonably have known at the time the certificate was issued that the applicant was french citizen and could safely be removed to france_ it could not be said on that ground that the certificate should not have been issued siac therefore continued by assessing the evidence against him in reaching our decision_ we will have to consider not only the open but also the closed material the appellant appears to have suspected that he was the subject of surveillance over much of the relevant period we are conscious of the need to be very careful not to assume guilt from association there must be more than friendship or consorting with those who are believed to be involved in international terrorism to justify reasonable suspicion that the appellant is himself involved in those activities or is at least knowingly supporting or assisting them we bear in mind his solicitor concerns that what has happened here is an attempt to resurrect the prosecution with nothing to add from his activities since detention must be regarded as last resort and so cannot be justified on the basis of association alone and in any event the guilt of the associates has never been established nonetheless_ continued association with those who are suspected of being involved in international terrorism with links to al qaeda in the light of the reasonable suspicion that the appellant was himself actively involved in terrorist activities for the gia is matter which can properly be taken into account the gspc_ which broke away from the gia_ has links to al qaeda and the appellant has continued to associate with those who took to the gspc rather than the gia we are in fact satisfied that not only was the appellant actively involved initially with the gia and then with the gspc but also that he provided false documentation for their members and for the mujahaddin in chechnya as is alleged in the open statement but we accept that his activities in and justify the use of the expression that he had been maintaining low profile_ and we make that observation having regard to both open and closed material nonetheless_ low profile does not mean that he is not properly to be regarded as an international terrorist within the meaning of section an assessment has to be made of what he may do in the light of what he has done and the fact that he has shown willingness and the ability to give assistance and support in the past and continues the associations and to provide some help the use of his van is highly relevant we have not found this aspect of the appellant case at all easy we have given full weight to all his solicitor submissions which were so persuasively put before us but in the end have reached the view that_ looking at the evidence as whole_ the decision to issue certificate was not wrong accordingly_ we would not have allowed the appeal on the facts the fifth applicant the fifth applicant was born in algeria in in his statement to siac he claimed to have developed polio as child which left him with permanently weak and paralysed right leg he was arrested and tortured by the algerian government in whereupon he left algeria for saudi arabia in he moved to pakistan and travelled to afghanistan on several occasions in august he entered the united kingdom and claimed asylum_ alleging in the course of that claim that his leg had been injured by shell in afghanistan in his asylum claim was refused and his appeal against the refusal was dismissed in december the applicant married french citizen and had child with her he was certified by the secretary of state under section of the act on december and detained on december in its judgment of october dismissing the fifth applicant appeal against certification_ siac observed the open statements provided to justify the certification do not refer to great deal of source material and so consist mainly of assertions as with most of these appeals_ the main part of the evidence lies in closed material and so_ as we are well aware_ the appellants have been at disadvantage in that they have not been able to deal with what might be taken to be incriminating evidence the special advocates have been able to challenge certain matters and sometimes to good effect that indeed was the case in relation to camp in dorset attended by number of those_ including the appellant_ of interest to the security service the case against the appellant is that he was member of the gia and_ since its split from the gia_ of the gspc he is associated with number of leading extremists_ some of whom are also members of or associated with the gspc_ and has provided active support in the form of the supply of false documents and facilitating young muslims from the united kingdom to travel to afghanistan to train for jihad he is regarded as having undertaken an important role in the support activities undertaken on behalf of the gspc and other islamic extremists in the united kingdom and outside it all this the appellant denies and in his statement he gives innocent explanations for the associations alleged against him he was indeed friendly with in particular other algerians in the united kingdom and_ so far as the fourth applicant was concerned_ the families were close because_ apart from anything else_ their respective wives were french he attended the eighth applicant mosque he was an impressive preacher and the appellant says he listened but was never involved indeed he did not know the eighth applicant except through chechen relief_ which the appellant and many hundreds of other muslims supported_ and he had never spoken to him on the telephone he had on occasions approached the eighth applicant at friday prayers at the mosque if he wanted guidance on some social problem siac referred to open surveillance reports which showed the applicant to have been in contact with other alleged members of gia and gspc_ including at camp in dorset in july further open evidence concerned his unhelpful and not altogether truthful responses to questioning by officers of the security service in july and september siac continued reliance is placed on various articles found in his house when he was arrested these include copy of the fatwa issued by bin laden the appellant says he had never seen it and could not explain its presence gspc communiqué was_ he says_ probably one handed out at the mosque analysis of the hard drive of his computer showed it had visited an internet site that specialised in united states military technology this was not something which could be relevant to the appellant studies and hand drawn diagram of missile rocket he has not seen before it might_ he thinks_ have been in book about islam he had bought second hand from the mosque we note the denials_ but we have to consider all the evidence as will be clear from this judgment_ we have reason to doubt some of the appellant assertions but the closed material confirms our view that there is indeed reasonable suspicion that the appellant is an international terrorist within the meaning of section and reasonable belief that his presence in the united kingdom is risk to national security we have no doubt that he has been involved in the production of false documentation_ has facilitated young muslims to travel to afghanistan to train for jihad and has actively assisted terrorists who have links with al qaeda we are satisfied too that he has actively assisted the gspc we have no hesitation in dismissing his appeal on april because of concerns about his health_ the fifth applicant was released from prison on bail on strict conditions_ which amounted to house arrest with further controls in its review judgment of july siac held in granting bail_ siac did not revise its view as to the strength of the grounds for believing he was an international terrorist and threat to national security the threat could be managed proportionately in his case in view of his severe mental illness that however is no reason to cancel the certificate there might be circumstances in which he breaches the terms of his bail or for other reasons it was necessary to revoke it the need for the certificate to continue must depend on whether the terms of the statute and of the derogation continue to be met number of his contacts remain at large including some who are regarded as actively involved in terrorist planning there is nothing to suggest that his mental illness has diminished his commitment to the extremist islamic cause he has the experience and capacity to involve himself once more in extremist activity the bail restraints on him are essential those are imposed pursuant to his certification and the siac dismissal of his appeal against it the certificate is properly maintained on december siac again reviewed the case and decided that the certificate should be maintained the sixth applicant the sixth applicant was born in algeria in and was resident in the united kingdom from the secretary of state issued certificate against him on december and he was taken into detention on december in its judgment of october siac observed as follows although we have to make our decision on the basis both of the open and of the closed material_ it is important to indicate the case against the sixth applicant as it has been set out by the secretary of state in open material_ because that is the case that the sixth applicant knows that he has to meet in assessing his statement and the other evidence and arguments submitted on his behalf_ we remind ourselves always that he is not aware of the secretary of state closed material_ but nevertheless that he is not operating entirely in vacuum because of the open allegations and we may test the appellant own case by the way he deals with those allegations the secretary of state case against the sixth applicant is summarised as follows he belongs to and or is member of the gspc_ and previously was involved with the gia he has supported and assisted the gspc and previously the gia through his involvement in credit card fraud which is main source of income in the united kingdom for the gspc from about august the sixth applicant took on an important role in procuring equipment for the gspc and the provision of logistical support for satellite phones by way of purchase and allocation of airtimes for those phones he has also played an important part in procuring equipment and other equipment for the mujahaddin fighting in chechnya that is to say the faction which until was under the command of ibn khattab siac then reviewed the open evidence before it regarding the purchase by abu doha_ assisted by the sixth and seventh applicants_ of number of satellite telephones and other equipment to the value of pounds sterling and the nature and extent of the connection between the sixth and seventh applicants it concluded in the circumstances we have set out_ it appears to us that the secretary of state has ample ground for suspicion that the sixth applicant procurement activities were directed to the support of the extremist arab islamist faction fighting in chechnya that support arises from the sixth applicant connections with and support of the gspc we emphasise_ as is the case with other appeals as well_ that it is the accumulation of factors_ each lending support to the others rather than undermining other points_ providing colour and context for the activities seen as whole which is persuasive it would be wrong to take piece in isolation_ thereby to diminish its significance and to miss the larger picture the generic judgment supports these conclusions these are activities falling centrally within the derogation the sixth applicant has provided only implausible denials and has failed to offer credible alternative explanations that is sufficient to determine his appeal_ without making any further reference to the secretary of state other allegations which_ as was acknowledged in the open statement and in open evidence before siac can be properly sustained only by examination of the closed material siac reviewed the case on july and on february and_ on each occasion_ decided that there were still grounds for maintaining the certificate the seventh applicant the seventh applicant was born in algeria in and apparently entered the united kingdom using false french identity papers in or before on december he was convicted of number of driving offences and sentenced to four months imprisonment he was certified by the secretary of state on february and taken into detention pursuant to the certificate as soon as his prison sentence ended on february in its judgment of october siac noted that the allegations against the seventh applicant were that he had been member of gspc since or and before that member of gia that his contacts with leading gspc members in the united kingdom showed that he was trusted member of the organisation and that he had been involved with abu doha and the sixth applicant in purchasing equipment for use by extremists in chechnya and algeria it further noted that the seventh applicant did not give evidence before siac and_ indeed_ chose not to attend the hearing of his appeal his statement_ which we have of course read_ is in the most general terms_ and_ perhaps not surprisingly_ his counsel submissions_ both oral and written_ were similarly general the seventh applicant approach to the present proceedings of themselves and the fact that he did not give oral evidence or make any detailed written statement are not matters to be put in the scale against him we well understand the difficulty that appellants have in circumstances where the allegations against them are only summarised and where much of the evidence on which those allegations are based cannot_ for reasons of national security_ be communicated to the appellants themselves however_ the seventh applicant is in the best position to know what his activities and motives have been in the relevant period nothing prevents him from giving full description and account of those activities if he wishes to do so the fact that he has chosen to provide no detailed account of his activities means that he has provided no material to counter the evidence and arguments of others siac concluded that the open and closed material supported the allegations against the seventh applicant and it dismissed his appeal in its review judgments of july and december siac decided that the certificate should be maintained the eighth applicant the eighth applicant is jordanian national_ born in bethlehem in he arrived in the united kingdom on september and claimed asylum he was recognised as refugee and granted leave to remain until june on may he applied for indefinite leave to remain but the application had not been determined at the time of the coming into force of the act the eighth applicant was convicted in absentia in jordan for his involvement in terrorist attacks there and in relation to plot to plant bombs to coincide with the millennium he was investigated in february by anti terrorism police officers in connection with plot to cause explosions at the strasbourg christmas market in december but no charges were brought against him when the act was passed he went into hiding he was arrested on october and was immediately made the subject of section certificate and taken into detention on the same date_ deportation order was made against him in its judgment of march dismissing the eighth applicant appeal against certification_ siac observed as follows the eighth applicant counsel on instructions from the appellant_ informed us that his client had chosen not to attend the hearing or to participate in any way he had read the decisions relating to the appellants who had been certified when the act came into force and the generic judgment and so felt certain that the result of his appeal was foregone conclusion there had been many references to his role in the other appeals and some had been certified and detained_ at least in part_ on the basis that they associated with him since that association was regarded as sufficient to justify their continued detention_ he considered that the decision on his appeal had_ in effect_ already been taken he had chosen not to play any part precisely because he has no faith in the ability of the system to get at the truth he considered that the siac procedure had deliberately been established to avoid open and public scrutiny of the respondent case_ which deprived individuals of fair opportunity to challenge the case against them having said that_ the eighth applicant counsel made it clear that the appeal was not being withdrawn it was accordingly necessary for us to consider it and to take into account the statement made by the appellant his counsel emphasised number of matters which_ he suggested_ should be regarded as favourable to the appellant contention that he was not and never had been involved in terrorism within the meaning of the act furthermore_ the allegations showed that distorted and over simplified view was being taken by the security services of the appellant activities and his role as respected teacher and believer in the rights of islamic communication throughout the world we should make it clear that we have considered the case against the appellant on its merits we have not been influenced by any findings made in other appeals or the generic judgments one of the reasons why this judgment has taken long time to be prepared was the need for us to read through and consider the evidence_ both open and closed_ that has been put before us there is much more of it than in most of the other appeals that is reflection of the fact that the appellant has been associated with and had dealings with many of the others who have been certified and with individuals and groups themselves linked to al qaeda we see no reason to dissent from the views expressed in the generic judgment of the significance of the various individuals and groups referred to in it but that does not mean we have therefore automatically accepted its views we draw attention to the fact that the panel which produced the generic judgment was not the same constitution as this panel and that such input as there was by the chairman of this panel to the generic judgment was limited to issues of law we have considered the case against the appellant on the material put before us in this appeal when it came to the closed session_ the special advocates informed us that after careful consideration they had decided that it would not be in the appellant interests for them to take any part in the proceedings we were very concerned at this_ taking the view that the decision was wrong the appeal was still being pursued and the appellant did not know what was relied on against him in the closed material we were unable to understand how in the circumstances it could not be in his interests for the special advocates_ at their discretion_ to elicit or identify matters favourable to the appellant and to make submissions to us to seek to persuade us that evidence was in fact unreliable or did not justify the assessment made when we asked one of the two special advocates appointed on behalf of the eighth applicant to tell us why he had decided as he had he told us that he could not do so since to do so would not be in the appellant interest we adjourned to enable the special advocates to seek to discover from the appellant through his representatives whether he did wish them to do what they could on his behalf and we also contacted the solicitor general who had appointed the special advocates to seek her help in trying to persuade them to assist us the appellant representatives indicated that they had nothing to say on the subject and the solicitor general took the view that it would be wrong for her to intervene in any way our further attempts to persuade the special advocates to change their minds were unsuccessful and since we could not compel them to act in any particular way we had to proceed without them counsel for the secretary of state at our request_ identified various matters which might be regarded as possibly exculpatory and we ourselves raised other matters in the course of the closed hearing we are conscious that the absence of special advocate makes our task even more difficult than it normally is and that the potential unfairness to the appellant is the more apparent we do not doubt that the special advocates believed they had good reasons for adopting the stance that they did and we are equally sure that they thought long and hard about whether they were doing the right thing but we are bound to record our clear view that they were wrong and that there could be no reason for not continuing to take part in an appeal that was still being pursued as it happens_ the evidence in this case against the appellant is so strong that no special advocates_ however brilliant_ could have persuaded us that reasonable suspicion had not been established so that the certification was not justified thus the absence of special advocates has not prejudiced the appellant siac then summarised the open case against the applicant_ which was that he had associated with and acted as spiritual adviser to number of individuals and groups linked with al qaeda he held extreme and fundamentalist views and had been reported as having_ in his speeches at london mosque_ given his blessing to the killing of jews and americans_ wherever they were siac concluded we are satisfied that the appellant activities went far beyond the mere giving of advice he has certainly given the support of the koran to those who wish to further the aims of al qaeda and to engage in suicide bombing and other murderous activities the evidence is sufficient to show that he has been concerned in the instigation of acts of international terrorism but spiritual advice given in the knowledge of the purposes for which and the uses to which it is to be put provides assistance within the meaning of section of the act there are large number of allegations made we see no point in dealing with them seriatim we have indicated why we have formed the view that the case made against the appellant is established indeed_ were the standard higher than reasonable suspicion_ we would have had no doubt that it was established the appellant was heavily involved_ indeed was at the centre in the united kingdom of terrorist activities associated with al qaeda he is truly dangerous individual and these appeals are dismissed the ninth applicant the ninth applicant is algerian_ born in in he left algeria for afghanistan_ where he taught arabic in refugee camp he claimed asylum in the united kingdom in in he was granted leave to remain for four years and in he was granted indefinite leave to remain_ on the basis that he was to be regarded as refugee on four occasions_ the last in may the applicant was arrested and released without charge the first three arrests related to credit card fraud the arrest in may related to alleged terrorist activities and the applicant was subsequently paid compensation by the police for false arrest the ninth applicant was certified by the secretary of state and made the subject of deportation order on april he was detained on the same day according to the evidence of one of the witnesses for the secretary of state_ he was not certified_ with the other applicants_ in december because one of his files had been lost in its judgment of october siac noted that the allegations against the ninth applicant were that he was an active supporter of gspc and had raised considerable sums of money for it through fraud there was evidence that the applicant had in the past been found_ by customs officers_ attempting to enter the united kingdom by ferry with large amounts of cash and that he had close links with others who had been convicted of credit card fraud siac held that evidence of involvement in fraud did not establish involvement in terrorism however_ it noted that the applicant had been present at camp in dorset in the company of the fifth applicant and number of others suspected of being gspc supporters and that telephone bill had been found at his house at the time of his arrest in the name of yarkas_ who had been arrested in spain in november due to his alleged links with al qaeda the applicant had given evidence but had not been convincing witness and had not given credible explanation for the foregoing the closed evidence supported the secretary of state allegations and siac therefore dismissed the applicant appeal against certification in its review judgments of july and december siac held that the certificate was properly maintained the tenth applicant the tenth applicant is an algerian national following bomb explosion in algeria_ his left hand was amputated at the wrist and his right arm was amputated below the elbow in he travelled to the united kingdom_ via abu dhabi and afghanistan_ and claimed asylum his claim was refused on february he was then in custody_ having been arrested on february and charged with possession of articles for suspected terrorist purposes_ conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to make false instruments at the time of his arrest he was found to have in his possession approximately forty blank french driving licences_ identity cards and passports_ credit card reader_ laminators and an embossing machine the charges were not_ however_ proceeded with and he was released on may on january the secretary of state issued certificate against him under section of the act and he was taken into detention deportation order was made against him on the same day in its judgment of january siac noted that the essence of the case against the tenth applicant was that since his arrival in the united kingdom he had been closely associated with network of extremists formerly led by abu doha see paragraph above in particular_ it was alleged that he had provided logistical support in the form of false documentation and money raised through credit card fraud he had spent lot of time at the finsbury park mosque_ known centre of islamist extremism_ and was alleged to have attended meeting there in june at which threats were made against the summit in genoa the applicant submitted written statement on june in which he denied the allegations against him he did not_ however_ participate in the hearing of his appeal_ as siac explained in its judgment he was_ said his counsel genuine refugee_ member of no organisation or group and not involved in terrorism or in advocating terrorism he had no knowledge of any planned terrorist attacks and could not understand why the accusations had been made against him he had seen none of the underlying material and had no means of challenging it in effect_ he could do no more than assert that it could not justify the conclusion that he was an international terrorist within the meaning of the act since he was not he had had read to him the decisions of siac in the previous appeals given the relevance which was placed on the closed material and the statutory test applicable_ he felt that the result was foregone conclusion he did not wish in participating in the appeal to give an impression which was false that he could deal with the matters which were being relied on against him he had no confidence in the proceedings accordingly he would take no active part in them beyond the statement which his counsel made on his behalf he did not withdraw his appeal while we appreciate the handicap under which he and indeed all the appellants labour_ we wish to make it clear that no appeal is foregone conclusion we have to and we do consider the evidence put before us_ whether open or closed_ with care because we recognise that the result is detention for an unspecified period without trial while we recognise that the special advocate has difficult task when he has and can obtain no instructions on closed material_ he is able to test evidence from the security service and to draw our attention to material which assists the appellant case siac found that there was ample evidence to support the view that the applicant was involved in fraudulent activities the evidence before it_ most of it closed_ was sufficient to establish that he was doing it to raise money for terrorist causes and to support those involved in terrorism it therefore dismissed the appeal against certification siac reached similar decisions in its review judgments of august and february in the latter judgment_ it noted that although the applicant had been transferred to broadmoor secure mental hospital because of mental health problems_ that made no difference to the assessment of the risk to national security which he would pose if released the eleventh applicant the eleventh applicant is an algerian national he entered the united kingdom in february using false italian identity card_ and claimed asylum the following week while his claim was pending_ in july he travelled to georgia using false french passport and was deported back to the united kingdom_ where he was informed that his travel outside the united kingdom had terminated his asylum claim he made second claim for asylum_ which was refused on august the applicant absconded he was arrested on october and held in an immigration detention centre_ from which he absconded in february he was rearrested on september and detained at belmarsh prison under immigration law provisions on october the secretary of state certified him as an international terrorist under section of the act and made deportation order against him on grounds of national security in its judgment of july dismissing the eleventh applicant appeal against certification_ siac set out the open case against him it was alleged that he was an established and senior member of the abu doha group see paragraph above in july he had attempted to travel to chechnya and_ when arrested by the georgian police_ he had been found in possession of telephone numbers associated with senior member of the abu doha group and named member of gspc_ who was known to be involved in fund raising for the chechen mujahaddin he was alleged to have provided money and logistical support to north african extremist islamist network based in pakistan and afghanistan_ with links to al qaeda_ and to have assisted members of the abu doha group in travelling to afghanistan_ pakistan and chechnya he had lived at the finsbury park mosque for over year in he was very security conscious and during trip to st albans in september he had taken measures to avoid being followed when he was arrested in september he was found in possession of false belgian passport bearing the photograph of senior member of the abu doha group he was alleged to have been heavily involved in the supply of false documents and the fraudulent use of cheque books and credit cards the applicant filed written statement in which he denied being an international terrorist he admitted that he had travelled to afghanistan in and that he had attempted to go to chechnya in but claimed that his interest in these countries was no more than that shown by many devout muslims he refused to participate in the hearing of his appeal or to be represented by lawyer_ in protest at the fundamental unfairness of the procedure in view of the applicant position_ the special advocates decided that his interests would best be served if they refrained from making submissions on his behalf or asking questions of the witnesses in the closed session in dismissing the applicant appeal_ siac held as follows we recognise the difficulties faced by an appellant who only sees only the open material and can understand the eleventh applicant perception that the procedures are unfair however_ each case will turn upon its own individual facts_ and it would be wrong to give the impression_ which his solicitor sought to do_ that this particular appellant had been placed in position where he was prevented by reason of the procedures under the act from mounting an effective defence in response to the case made against him we have summarised the information made available to the eleventh applicant at the various stages of the procedure and his response to this information in his written statement while some of the assessments in the open material can fairly be described as general assertions unsupported by any documentary evidence_ in response to which the eleventh applicant would not have been able to give any more than an equally general denial_ it is clear that in respect of other assessments he was provided with great deal of detailed information names_ dates_ places and supporting documents the eleventh applicant is in the best position to give an account of his whereabouts and activities since he first claimed asylum in his written statement is significant not so much for what it says_ as for what it does not say to take one example the visit to st albans and the photo booth where the eleventh applicant says that the respondent specific assertion is completely wrong the eleventh applicant has not denied that he went to st albans he knows who accompanied him and why they went there he has not explained why they went there_ nor has he identified his companion_ despite having been provided with the photographs taken during the surveillance operation siac continued by noting the inconsistencies in the applicant various accounts of his trips to afghanistan_ georgia and dubai and his failure to deal with the secretary of state allegations that he had associated with various members of the abu doha group_ identified by name siac continued the matters referred to are not an exhaustive list_ merely the most obvious examples of the way in which the eleventh applicant written statement fails to deal with the open case made against him given the unsatisfactory nature of the statement we do not feel able to give any significant weight to the general denials contained within it we have dealt with these matters in some detail because they are useful illustrations of the extent to which the eleventh applicant would have been able to answer the case against him_ if he had chosen to do so while we do not draw any adverse inference from his failure to give evidence_ or otherwise participate in the hearing of his appeal_ we do have to determine his appeal on the evidence and we are left with the position that there has been no effective challenge by way of evidence_ cross examination or submission to the open material produced by the respondent the standard of proof prescribed by section of the act is relatively low are there reasonable grounds for belief or suspicion as explained above_ we are satisfied that this low threshold is easily crossed on the basis of the open material alone if the totality of the material_ both open and closed_ is considered_ we have no doubt that the eleventh applicant was senior_ and active_ member of the abu doha group as described in the respondent evidence the conditions of detention and the effect of detention on the applicants health the detained applicants were all initially detained at belmarsh prison in london the sixth applicant was transferred to woodhill prison and the first_ seventh and tenth applicants were transferred to broadmoor secure mental hospital they were held in prison under the same regime as other standard risk category prisoners_ which was considered the appropriate security classification on the basis of the risk they posed they were allowed visitors_ once those visitors had been security cleared_ and could associate with other prisoners_ make telephone calls and write and receive letters they had access to an imam and to their legal representatives they had the same level of access to health care_ exercise_ education and work as any other prisoner of their security ranking following recommendation of the inspector appointed under the act to review the detention regime_ the government created special unit at woodhill prison to house the act detainees the unit_ which was refurbished in consultation with the detained applicants and their representatives and had specially selected and trained staff_ would have allowed for more relaxed regime_ including more out of cell time the applicants_ however_ chose not to move to the unit_ decision which the inspector found regrettable the first applicant_ who alleged history of ill treatment in israeli detention and who had first been treated for depression in may suffered severe deterioration in his mental health while detained in belmarsh prison he was transferred to broadmoor secure mental hospital in july the seventh applicant reported family history of psychiatric disorder and had experienced depression as an adolescent he claimed to suffer increasingly throughout his detention from depression_ paranoia and auditory hallucinations he attempted suicide in may and was transferred to broadmoor secure mental hospital on november the tenth applicant_ double amputee_ claimed to have been detained and tortured in algeria he suffered deterioration in his physical and mental health in belmarsh prison he went on hunger strike in may june and refused to use the prostheses which had been issued to him or to cooperate with his nurses early in november the prison authorities withdrew his nursing care his legal representatives applied for judicial review of this decision and in december nursing care was resumed following the order of the administrative court on november the tenth applicant was transferred to broadmoor secure mental hospital the european committee for the prevention of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment cpt visited the detained applicants in february and again in march and made number of criticisms of the conditions in which the detained applicants were held the government rejected these criticisms see paragraphs below in october at the request of the applicants legal group of eight consultant psychiatrists prepared joint psychiatric report on the detained applicants_ which concluded the detainees originate from countries where mental illness is highly stigmatised in addition_ for devout muslims there is direct prohibition against suicide this is particularly significant given the number who have attempted or are considering suicide all of the detainees have serious mental health problems which are the direct result of_ or are seriously exacerbated by_ the indefinite nature of the detention the mental health problems predominantly take the form of major depressive disorder and anxiety number of detainees have developed psychotic symptoms_ as they have deteriorated some detainees are also experiencing ptsd post traumatic stress disorder either as result of their pre migration trauma_ the circumstances around their arrest and imprisonment or the interaction between the two continued deterioration in their mental health is affected also by the nature of_ and their mistrust in_ the prison regime and the appeals process as well as the underlying and central factor of the indefinite nature of detention the prison health care system is unable to meet their health needs adequately there is failure to perceive self harm and distressed behaviour as part of the clinical condition rather than merely being seen as manipulation there is inadequate provision for complex physical health problems their mental health problems are unlikely to resolve while they are maintained in their current situation and given the evidence of repeated interviews it is highly likely that they will continue to deteriorate while in detention the problems described by the detainees are remarkably similar to the problems identified in the literature examining the impact of immigration detention this literature describes very high levels of depression and anxiety and eloquently makes the point that the length of time in detention relates directly to the severity of symptoms and that it is detention per se which is causing these problems to deteriorate for the purposes of the present proceedings_ the government requested consultant psychiatrist_ dr to comment on the above joint psychiatric report dr was critical of the methodology and conclusions of the authors of the joint report in particular_ he wrote references to other reports omitted would comment that find many of the assertions made do not bear close inspection for example in the case of the first applicant it was my finding after careful and detailed assessment that his mental state after imprisonment and then detention in broadmoor hospital was_ overall_ no worse and arguably no better than it had been before he was arrested nor do his records suggest initial improvement followed by deterioration in broadmoor hospital found he deteriorated in hmp belmarsh prison because he chose to go on hunger strike and that he had fluctuating course in broadmoor hospital despite agreeing to eat_ his histrionic behaviour in both places being essentially the same in his case found the diagnosis to be one of personality disorder_ diagnoses of major depressive disorder_ psychosis and ptsd not being sustainable moreover_ it was my finding that his frequent self harming was indeed manipulative am not alone in finding the diagnoses claimed by the authors of this report to be mistaken and have drawn attention in my own report to the scepticism of some others who have reported on the first and seventh applicants it is not the case therefore that there is the consensus of opinion claimed in the report and note that in both the cases assessed the first and seventh applicants their so called psychotic symptoms claimed by some reporters and said not to be present before they were detained_ were in fact present before they were arrested an issue find to be of the greatest concern relates to the tacit acceptance of information gained by self report it appears to be accepted by the authors of the report_ for example_ that three of the detainees had been the victims of detention and torture and all felt themselves seriously threatened prior to migration nowhere have seen any evidence to corroborate these claims or indeed any attempt to check them as it is the case that immigrants and asylum seekers need to justify their attempts to gain entry to another country_ is it not possible or even probable that some may not always be entirely truthful in what they claim about their past experiences or their current symptoms where alleged terrorists are concerned it should be borne in mind that they have denied such allegations in spite of the open and closed evidence against them_ which has been considered at the highest level surely this should raise doubts about their truthfulness the release of the fifth applicant on bail on january siac decided that it should_ in principle_ grant bail to the fifth applicant the secretary of state attempted to appeal against this decision but was informed by the court of appeal in an interim decision dated february that it had no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal siac explained its reasons for granting bail in greater detail in judgment dated april it held that under the act it had power to grant bail only in an exceptional case_ where it was satisfied that if bail were not granted the detainee mental or physical condition would deteriorate to such an extent as to render his continued detention breach of article of the convention on grounds of inhumanity_ or article on grounds of siac noted that there had been concerns about the fifth applicant mental health among prison staff from may although these concerns had not been communicated to his legal representatives in december he had suffered serious relapse into severe depression with psychotic symptoms_ including auditory hallucinations and suicide ideation number of psychologists and psychiatrists had examined him_ at the request of his legal representatives and at the initiative of the home office_ and had agreed that he was seriously ill and that his mental health would be likely to improve if he were allowed to go home siac concluded we do not think that the threshold has been crossed so that there is breach of the fifth applicant human rights the jurisprudence of the european court of human rights emphasises the high threshold which must be crossed and that detention is unlikely to be regarded as unless it at least verges on treatment which would constitute breach of article but we are satisfied that_ if he were not released_ there would be such breach to permit someone to reach state whereby he requires treatment in special hospital or continuous care and attention to ensure he does not harm himself can constitute breach of article unless perhaps there is no possible alternative to detention_ and probably of article as we have said_ we do not have to wait until that situation exists provided that we are persuaded_ as we are_ that the conditions we impose are sufficient to minimise the risk to the security of the state if the fifth applicant is released_ we can act as we have we must emphasise that the grant of bail is exceptional we are only doing so because the medical evidence is all one way and the detention has caused the mental illness which will get worse the fifth applicant was_ therefore_ released on bail on april on conditions amounting to house arrest he was not permitted to leave his home address and had to wear an electronic tag at all times he had no internet access and telephone link to the security service only he was required to report by telephone to the security service five times day and allow its agents access to his home at any time he was not permitted contact with any person other than his wife and child_ legal representative and home office approved doctor or see any visitor except with prior home office approval events following the house of lords judgment of december the declaration of incompatibility made by the house of lords on december in common with all such declarations_ was not binding on the parties to the litigation see paragraph below the applicants remained in detention_ except for the second and fourth applicants who had elected to leave the united kingdom and the fifth applicant who had been released on bail on conditions amounting to house arrest moreover_ none of the applicants was entitled_ under domestic law_ to compensation in respect of their detention the applicants_ therefore_ lodged their application to the court on january at the end of january the government announced their intention to repeal part of the act and replace it with regime of control orders_ which would impose various restrictions on individuals_ regardless of nationality_ reasonably suspected of being involved in terrorism those applicants who remained in detention were released on march and immediately made subject to control orders under the prevention of terrorism act which came into effect on march the government withdrew the derogation notice on march on august following negotiations commenced towards the end of to seek from the algerian and jordanian governments assurances that the applicants would not be ill treated if returned_ the government served notices of intention to deport on the fifth_ sixth_ seventh_ eighth_ ninth_ tenth and eleventh applicants these applicants were taken into immigration custody pending removal to algeria the fifth_ sixth_ seventh_ ninth_ tenth and eleventh applicants and jordan the eighth applicant on april the court of appeal ruled that the eighth applicant could not lawfully be extradited to jordan_ because it was likely that evidence which had been obtained by torture could be used against him there at trial_ in flagrant violation of his right to fair trial at the date of adoption of the present judgment_ the case was pending before the house of lords ii relevant domestic law and practicea detention pending deportation before the passing of the act under section of the immigration act the act the secretary of state could make deportation order against non national_ on the ground that the deportation would be conducive to the public good_ for reasons of national security_ inter alia person who was the subject of deportation order could be detained pending deportation the act_ schedule paragraph however_ it was held in governor of durham prison_ ex parte hardial singh wlr that the power to detain under the above provision was limited to such time as was reasonable to enable the process of deportation to be carried out detention was not_ therefore_ permissible under the act where deportation was known to be impossible_ whether because there was no country willing to take the person in question or because there would be risk of torture or other serious ill treatment to the proposed deportee in his or her country of origin the terrorism act in july parliament enacted the terrorism act as lord bingham noted in his judgment in the present case_ this was substantial measure_ with sections and schedules_ intended to overhaul_ modernise and strengthen the law relating to the growing problem of terrorism terrorism was defined_ in section of the act_ as the use or threat of action where the action falls within subsection the use or threat is designed to influence the government or to intimidate the public or section of the public and the use or threat is made for the purpose of advancing political_ religious or

the same name as an organisation listed in that schedule subsection shall not apply in relation to an organisation listed in schedule if its entry is the subject of note in that schedule the secretary of state may by order add an organisation to schedule remove an organisation from that schedule amend that schedule in some other way the secretary of state may exercise his power under subsection in respect of an organisation only if he believes that it is concerned in terrorism for the purposes of subsection an organisation is concerned in terrorism if it commits or participates in acts of

committed the anti terrorism_ crime and security act part of the act see paragraph above which was headed immigration and asylum set out powers which enabled the detention of non nationals suspected of being international terrorists_ even where their deportation was for the time being impossible the act provided_ so far as material part immigration and asylumsuspected international terrorists

detention of persons liable to examination or removal and paragraph of schedule to that act detention pending deportation part of the act included provision that the legislation would remain in force for five years only and was subject to an annual affirmative resolution by both houses of parliament the special immigration appeals commission siac siac was set up in response to the court judgment in chahal the united kingdom gc november reports of judgments and decisions it is tribunal composed of independent judges_ with right of appeal against its decisions on point of law to the court of appeal and the house of lords by section of the act suspected international terrorist may appeal to the special immigration appeals commission against his certification under section on an appeal siac must cancel the certificate if it considers that there are no reasonable grounds for belief or suspicion of the kind referred to in section or or if it considers that for some other reason the certificate should not have been issued siac was required to carry out first review to ensure that the certificate was still justified six months after the issue of the certificate or six months after the final determination of an appeal against certification_ and thereafter at three monthly intervals under section of the act_ any legal challenge to the derogation under article of the convention had also to be made to siac siac has special procedure which enables it to consider not only material which can be made public open material but also material which_ for reasons of national security_ cannot closed material neither the appellant nor his legal adviser can see the closed material accordingly_ one or more security cleared counsel_ referred to as special advocates are appointed by the solicitor general to act on behalf of each appellant in the certification appeals before siac at issue in the present case_ the open statements and evidence concerning each appellant were served first_ and the special advocate could discuss this material with the appellant and his legal advisers and take instructions generally then the closed material would be disclosed to the judges and to the special advocate_ from which point there could be no further contact between the latter and the appellant and or his save with the permission of siac it was the special advocate role during the closed sessions to make submissions on behalf of the appellant_ both as regards procedural matters_ such as the need for further disclosure_ and as to the substance of the case in respect of each appeal against certification_ siac issued both an open and closed judgment the special advocate could see both but the detainee and his representatives could see only the open judgment declarations of incompatibility under the human rights act section of the act provides that where court finds that primary legislation is in breach of the convention_ the court may make declaration of incompatibility such declaration does not affect the validity of the provision in respect of which it is made and is not binding on the parties to the proceedings in which it is made_ but special arrangements may be made section to amend the provision in order to remove the incompatibility see_ further_ burden the united kingdom gc no and echr the terrorism act the terrorism act came into force on march creating number of offences to extend criminal liability to acts preparatory to the terrorist offences created by the terrorism act the new offences were encouragement_ dissemination of publications_ preparation and training the offences were designed to intervene at an early stage in terrorist activity and thus prevent the development of more serious conduct they were also designed to be easier to prove consideration of the use of special advocates under the prevention of terrorism act on october the house of lords gave judgment in secretary of state for the home department respondent mb fc appellant ukhl which concerned challenge to non derogating control order made by the secretary of state under sections and of the prevention of terrorism act the house of lords had to decide_ inter alia_ whether procedures provided for by section of the act_ involving closed hearings and special advocates_ were compatible with article of the convention_ given that_ in the case of one of the appellants_ they had resulted in the case against him being in its essence entirely undisclosed_ with no specific allegation of terrorism related activity being contained in open material the house of lords was unanimous in holding that the proceedings in question determined civil rights and obligations and thus attracted the protection of article on the question of compliance_ the majority baroness hale_ lord carswell and lord brown held that although in many cases the special advocate procedure would provide sufficient counterbalance where the secretary of state wished to withhold material upon which she wished to rely in order to establish the existence of reasonable grounds for suspecting that the controlee was or had been involved in terrorism related activity_ each case had to be considered individually baroness hale put it as follows it would all depend upon the nature of the case what steps had been taken to explain the detail of the allegations to the controlled person so that he could anticipate what the material in support might be what steps had been taken to summarise the closed material in support without revealing names_ dates or places the nature and content of the material withheld how effectively the special advocate had been able to challenge it on behalf of the controlled person and what difference its disclosure might have made all of these factors would be relevant to whether the controlled person had been given meaningful opportunity to contest the factual basis for the order do not think that we can be confident that strasbourg would hold that every control order hearing in which the special advocate procedure had been used_ as contemplated by the act and part of the civil procedure rules_ would be sufficient to comply with article however_ with strenuous efforts from all_ difficult and time consuming though it will be_ it should usually be possible to accord the controlled person substantial measure of procedural justice everyone involved will have to do their best to ensure that the principles of judicial inquiry are complied with to the fullest extent possible the secretary of state must give as full as possible an explanation of why she considers that the grounds in section are made out the fuller the explanation given_ the fuller the instructions that the special advocates will be able to take from the client before they see the closed material both judge and special advocates will have to probe the claim that the closed material should remain closed with great care and considerable scepticism there is ample evidence from elsewhere of tendency to over claim the need for secrecy in terrorism cases see serrin turner and stephen schulhofer_ the secrecy problem in terrorism trials_ brennan centre for justice at nyu school of law both judge and special advocates will have stringently to test the material which remains closed all must be alive to the possibility that material could be redacted or gisted in such way as to enable the special advocates to seek the client instructions upon it all must be alive to the possibility that the special advocates be given leave to ask specific and carefully tailored questions of the client although not expressly provided for in cpr the special advocate should be able to call or have called witnesses to rebut the closed material the nature of the case may be such that the client does not need to know all the details of the evidence in order to make an effective challenge the best judge of whether the proceedings have afforded sufficient and substantial measure of procedural protection is likely to be the judge who conducted the hearing lord carswell observed there is very wide spectrum of cases in which closed material is relied on by the secretary of state at one extreme there may be cases in which the sole evidence adverse to the controlee is closed material_ he cannot be told what the evidence is or even given its gist and the special advocate is not in position to take sufficient instructions to mount an effective challenge to the adverse allegations at the other end there may be cases where the probative effect of the closed material is very slight or merely corroborative of strong open material and there is no obstacle to presenting defence there is an infinite variety of possible cases in between the balance between the open material and the closed material and the probative nature of each will vary from case to case the special advocate may be able to discern with sufficient clarity how to deal with the closed material without obtaining direct instructions from the controlee these are matters for the judge to weigh up and assess in the process of determining whether the controlee has had fair trial the assessment is fact specific the judge who has seen both the open and the closed material and had the benefit of the contribution of the special advocate is in much the best position to make it do consider_ however_ that there is fairly heavy burden on the controlee to establish that there has been breach of article for the legitimate public interest in withholding material on valid security grounds should be given due weight the courts should not be too ready to hold that disadvantage suffered by the controlee through the withholding of material constitutes breach of article lord brown held as follows there may perhaps be cases_ wholly exceptional though they are likely to be_ where_ despite the best efforts of all concerned by way of redaction_ anonymisation_ and gisting_ it will simply be impossible to indicate sufficient of the secretary of state case to enable the suspect to advance any effective challenge to it unless in these cases the judge can nevertheless feel quite sure that in any event no possible challenge could conceivably have succeeded difficult but not_ think_ impossible conclusion to arrive at he would have to conclude that the making or_ as the case may be_ confirmation of an order would indeed involve significant injustice to the suspect in short_ the suspect in such case would not have been accorded even substantial measure of procedural justice chahal_ cited above notwithstanding the use of the special advocate procedure the very essence of his right to fair hearing will have been impaired tinnelly sons ltd and others and mcelduff and others the united kingdom_ cited below lord bingham did not dissent but employed different reasoning he held that it was necessary to look at the process as whole and consider whether procedure had been used which involved significant injustice to the controlee while the use of special advocates could help to enhance the measure of procedural justice available to controlled person_ it could not fully remedy the grave disadvantages of person not being aware of the case against him and not being able_ therefore_ effectively to instruct the special advocate lord hoffmann_ dissenting_ held that once the trial judge had decided that disclosure would be contrary to the public interest_ the use of special advocates provided sufficient safeguards for the controlee and there would never in these circumstances be breach of article in secretary of state for the home department af ewca civ the court of appeal sir anthony clark mr and waller lj sedley lj dissenting gave the following guidance_ based on the majority opinions in the case of mb see paragraph above regarding compliance with article in control order cases using special advocates extract from the head note in deciding whether the hearing under section of the act infringed the controlee rights under article the question was whether_ taken as whole_ the hearing was fundamentally unfair to the controlee_ or he was not accorded substantial measure of procedural justice or the very essence of his right to fair hearing was impaired more broadly_ the question was whether the effect of the process was that the controlee was exposed to significant injustice all proper steps ought to be taken to provide the controlee with as much information as possible_ both in terms of allegation and evidence_ if necessary by appropriate gisting where the full allegations and evidence were not provided for reasons of national security at the outset_ the controlee had to be provided with special advocate in such case the following principles applied there was no principle that hearing would be unfair in the absence of open disclosure to the controlee of an irreducible minimum of allegation or evidence alternatively_ if there was_ the irreducible minimum could_ depending on the circumstances_ be met by disclosure of as little information as was provided in af case_ which was very little indeed whether hearing would be unfair depended on all the circumstances_ including the nature of the case_ what steps had been taken to explain the detail of the allegations to the controlled person so that he could anticipate what the material in support might be_ what steps had been taken to summarise the closed material in support without revealing names_ dates or places_ the nature and content of the material withheld_ how effectively the special advocate was able to challenge it on behalf of the controlee and what difference its disclosure would or might make in considering whether open disclosure to the controlee would have made difference to the answer to whether there were reasonable grounds for suspicion that the controlee was or had been involved in terrorist related activity_ the court had to have fully in mind the problems for the controlee and the special advocates and take account of all the circumstances of the case_ including what_ if any_ information was openly disclosed and how effective the special advocates were able to be the correct approach to and the weight to be given to any particular factor would depend upon the particular circumstances there were no rigid principles what was fair was essentially matter for the judge_ with whose decision the court of appeal would very rarely interfere iii domestic and international comment on part of the acta the newton committee part of the act provided for the creation of committee of privy counsellors to review its operation the committee_ under the chairmanship of lord newton_ reported in december having recorded the home office argument that the threat from al qaeda terrorism was predominantly from foreigners_ the newton committee report drew attention to accumulating evidence that this is not now the case the british suicide bombers who attacked tel aviv in may richard reid the shoe bomber and recent arrests suggest that the threat from uk citizens is real almost of terrorism act suspects in the past year have been british we have been told that_ of the people of interest to the authorities because of their suspected involvement in international terrorism_ nearly half are british nationals given this evidence_ the newton committee observed that not only were there arguments of principle against having discriminatory provisions_ but there were also compelling arguments of limited efficacy in addressing the terrorist threat the newton committee therefore called for new legislation to be introduced as matter of urgency which would deal with the terrorist threat without discrimination on grounds of nationality and which would not require derogation from article of the convention in february the government published their response to the newton committee report it continued to accept that the terrorist threat came predominantly_ but not exclusively_ from foreign nationals and made the following observation about the newton committee suggestion that counter terrorist measures should apply to all persons within the jurisdiction regardless of nationality while it would be possible to seek other powers to detain british citizens who may be involved in international terrorism it would be very grave step the government believes that such draconian powers would be difficult to justify experience has demonstrated the dangers of such an approach and the damage it can do to community cohesion and thus to support from all parts of the public that is so essential to countering the terrorist threat the government also indicated that work was under way to try to establish framework agreements with potential destination countries for the purposes of deportation of terrorist suspects the joint parliamentary committee on human rights the joint committee has constitutional responsibility in the united kingdom for scrutinising legislation to ensure that it is compatible with convention rights in its second report of the session drawn up very shortly after publication of the bill which became the act_ the joint committee expressed concern at the potentially discriminatory effect of the proposed measure_ as follows second_ by relying on immigration legislation to provide for the detention of suspected international terrorists_ the bill risks discriminating_ in the authorisation of detention without charge_ between those suspected international terrorists who are subject to immigration control and those who have an unconditional right to remain in the united kingdom we are concerned that this might lead to discrimination in the enjoyment of the right to liberty on the ground of nationality if that could not be shown to have an objective_ rational and proportionate justification_ it might lead to actions which would be incompatible with article of the echr the convention either taken alone or in combination with the right to be free of discrimination in the enjoyment of convention rights under article of the echr the convention it could also lead to violations of the right to be free of discrimination under article and the right to liberty under article of the iccpr international covenant on civil and political rights we raised this matter with the home secretary in oral evidence having considered his response_ we are not persuaded that the risk of discrimination on the ground of nationality in the provisions of part of the bill has been sufficiently taken on board in its sixth report of the session february the joint committee expressed deep concern about the human rights implications of making the detention power an aspect of immigration law rather than anti terrorism law and warned of significant risk that part violates the right to be free of discrimination under echr the convention article following the report of the newton committee and the secretary of state discussion paper published in response to it_ the joint committee returned to this subject in its eighteenth report of the session july paragraphs the discussion paper rejects the newton report recommendation that new legislation replacing part of the act should apply equally to all nationalities including british citizens it states the government belief that it is defensible to distinguish between foreign nationals and uk nationals because of their different rights and we have consistently expressed our concern that the provisions of part of the act unjustifiably discriminate on grounds of nationality and are therefore in breach of article echr of the convention along with lord newton_ we find it extraordinary that the discussion paper asserts that seeking the same power to detain british citizens would be very grave step and that such draconian powers would be difficult to justify the interests at stake for foreign national and uk national are the same their fundamental right to liberty under article echr of the convention and related procedural rights article of the echr the convention requires states to secure the convention rights to everyone within their jurisdiction article requires the enjoyment of convention rights to be secured without discrimination on the ground of nationality the government explanation in its discussion paper of its reluctance to seek the same powers in relation to uk nationals appears to suggest that it regards the liberty interests of foreign nationals as less worthy of protection than exactly the same interests of uk nationals_ which is impermissible under the convention the european committee for the prevention of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment cpt the cpt visited the detained applicants in february and again in march in its report published on june the cpt was critical of the conditions in which the applicants were held in belmarsh prison and broadmoor secure mental hospital and reported allegations of ill treatment by staff it found the regime in woodhill prison to be more relaxed the cpt found that the health of the majority of the detained applicants had declined as result of their detention_ in particular its indefinite character the cpt stated in its report in fact_ the information gathered during the visit reveals that the authorities are at loss at how to manage this type of detained person_ imprisoned with no real prospect of release and without the necessary support to counter the damaging effects of this unique form of detention they also highlight the limited capacity of the prison system to respond to task that is difficult to reconcile with its normal the stated objective_ in the response to the cpt report on the february visit_ of formulating strategy to enable the prison service to manage most appropriately the care and detention of persons held under the act_ has not been achieved two years after the cpt visited these detained persons_ many of them were in poor mental state as result of their detention_ and some were also in poor physical condition detention had caused mental disorders in the majority of persons detained under the act and for those who had been subjected to traumatic experiences or even torture in the past_ it had clearly reawakened the experience and even led to the serious recurrence of former disorders the trauma of detention had become even more detrimental to their health since it was combined with an absence of control resulting from the indefinite character of their detention_ the uphill difficulty of challenging their detention and the fact of not knowing what evidence was being used against them to certify and or uphold their certification as persons suspected of international terrorism for some of them_ their situation at the time of the visit could be considered as amounting to inhuman and degrading treatment the government published their response to the cpt report on june the government strongly disputed the allegations of ill treatment by prison staff and pointed out that the detained applicants had at their disposal the remedies provided by administrative and civil law to all prisoners to complain of ill treatment the government response continued although the government respects the conclusions reached by the delegates of the cpt based on the observations on the day of visit_ it categorically rejects the suggestion that at any point during their detention the act detainees were treated in an inhuman or degrading manner that may have amounted to breach in the united kingdom international human rights obligations the government firmly believes that at all times the detainees received appropriate care and treatment in belmarsh and had access to all necessary medical support_ both physical and psychological_ from medical support staff and doctors the government accepts that the individuals had difficult backgrounds prior to detention_ but does not accept that detention had caused mental disorders some of the detainees had mental health issues prior to detention_ but that did not stop them engaging in the activities that led to their certification and detention mental health issues do not prevent an individual from posing risk to national security the government does not accept that those certified under the act were detained without any prospect of their release on no occasion did siac_ or any other court_ find that the conditions of detention breached the absolute obligation imposed upon the government by article of the convention it is the government view that_ given the extensive judicial safeguards available to the detainees_ the government would not have been able to maintain the detention of these individuals had the powers breached the detainees article rights in any way to suggest otherwise would be to ignore the extensive contact the detainees had with the british judicial system and the absolute obligation upon the judiciary to protect against any such breach the european commissioner for human rights in august the european commissioner for human rights to the council of europe published his opinion on certain aspects of the united kingdom derogation from article of the convention and part of the act in that opinion he expressly criticised the lack of sufficient scrutiny by parliament of the derogation provisions and questioned whether the nature of the al qaeda threat was justifiable basis for recognising public emergency threatening the life of the nation whilst acknowledging the obligations of the governments to protect their citizens against the threat of terrorism_ the commissioner is of the opinion that general appeals to an increased risk of terrorist activity post september cannot_ on their own be sufficient to justify derogating from the convention several european states long faced with recurring terrorist activity have not considered it necessary to derogate from convention rights nor have any found it necessary to do so under the present circumstances detailed information pointing to real and imminent danger to public safety in the united kingdom will_ therefore_ have to be shown the commissioner continued_ with reference to the detention scheme under part of the act in so far as these measures are applicable only to non deportable foreigners_ they might appear_ moreover_ to be ushering in two track justice_ whereby different human rights standards apply to foreigners and nationals on june the commissioner published report arising out of his visit to the united kingdom in november he specifically referred to the house of lords decision in the applicants case and noted the fact that the government had not sought to renew the relevant provisions of the act in march he welcomed the decision of the house of lords_ which corresponded with his own previously published opinion_ and also welcomed the release of the applicants_ emphasising that as result of his visit he was in position personally to testify to the extremely agitated psychological state of many of them as result of interviews which he had conducted with_ among others_ the home secretary_ the lord chancellor_ the attorney general_ the lord chief justice and the director of public prosecutions_ the commissioner also expressed conclusion about the availability under the law of the united kingdom of alternative measures to combat the threat of terrorism terrorist activity not only must but can be combated within the existing framework of human rights guarantees_ which provide precisely for balancing_ in questions concerning national security_ of individual rights and the public interest and allow for the use of proportionate special powers what is required is well resourced policing_ international cooperation and the forceful application of the law it is to be noted_ in this context_ that in the terrorist act the united

 AL-ADSANI v. THE UNITED KINGDOM,the factsi the circumstances of the casea the alleged ill treatment the applicant made the following allegations concerning the events underlying the dispute he submitted to the english courts the government stated that they were not in position to comment on the accuracy of these claims the applicant_ who is trained pilot_ went to kuwait in to assist in its defence against iraq during the gulf war he served as member of the kuwaiti air force and_ after the iraqi invasion_ he remained behind as member of the resistance movement during that period he came into possession of sex videotapes involving sheikh jaber al sabah al saud al sabah the sheikh who is related to the emir of kuwait and is said to have an influential position in kuwait by some means these tapes entered general circulation_ for which the applicant was held responsible by the sheikh after the iraqi armed forces were expelled from kuwait_ on or about may the sheikh and two others gained entry to the applicant house_ beat him and took him at gunpoint in government jeep to the kuwaiti state security prison the applicant was falsely imprisoned there for several days during which he was repeatedly beaten by security guards he was released on may having been forced to sign false confession on or about may the sheikh took the applicant at gunpoint in government car to the palace of the emir of kuwait brother at first the applicant head was repeatedly held underwater in swimming pool containing corpses_ and he was then dragged into small room where the sheikh set fire to mattresses soaked in petrol_ as result of which the applicant was seriously burnt initially the applicant was treated in kuwaiti hospital_ and on may he returned to england where he spent six weeks in hospital being treated for burns covering of his total body surface area he also suffered psychological damage and has been diagnosed as suffering from severe form of post traumatic stress disorder_ aggravated by the fact that_ once in england_ he received threats warning him not to take action or give publicity to his plight the civil proceedings on august the applicant instituted civil proceedings in england for compensation against the sheikh and the state of kuwait in respect of injury to his physical and mental health caused by torture in kuwait in may and threats against his life and well being made after his return to the united kingdom on may on december he obtained default judgment against the sheikh the proceedings were re issued after an amendment to include two named individuals as defendants on july deputy high court judge ex parte gave the applicant leave to serve the proceedings on the individual defendants this decision was confirmed in chambers on august he was not_ however_ granted leave to serve the writ on the state of kuwait the applicant submitted renewed application to the court of appeal_ which was heard ex parte on january judgment was delivered the same day the court held_ on the basis of the applicant allegations_ that there were three elements pointing towards state responsibility for the events in kuwait firstly_ the applicant had been taken to state prison secondly_ government transport had been used on and may and_ thirdly_ in the prison he had been mistreated by public officials it found that the applicant had established good arguable case_ based on principles of international law_ that kuwait should not be afforded immunity under section of the state immunity act the act see paragraph below in respect of acts of torture in addition_ there was medical evidence indicating that the applicant had suffered damage post traumatic stress while in the united kingdom it followed that the conditions in order rule of the rules of the supreme court had been satisfied see paragraph below and that leave should be granted to serve the writ on the state of kuwait the kuwaiti government_ after receiving the writ_ sought an order striking out the proceedings the application was examined inter partes by the high court on march in judgment delivered the same day the court held that it was for the applicant to show on the balance of probabilities that the state of kuwait was not entitled to immunity under the act it was prepared provisionally to accept that the government were vicariously responsible for conduct that would qualify as torture under international law however_ international law could be used only to assist in interpreting lacunae or ambiguities in statute_ and when the terms of statute were clear_ the statute had to prevail over international law the clear language of the act bestowed immunity upon sovereign states for acts committed outside the jurisdiction and_ by making express provision for exceptions_ it excluded as matter of construction implied exceptions as result_ there was no room for an implied exception for acts of torture in section of the act moreover_ the court was not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the state of kuwait was responsible for the threats made to the applicant after may as result_ the exception provided for by section of the act could not apply it followed that the action against the state should be struck out the applicant appealed and the court of appeal examined the case on march the court held that the applicant had not established on the balance of probabilities that the state of kuwait was responsible for the threats made in the united kingdom the important question was_ therefore_ whether state immunity applied in respect of the alleged events in kuwait lord justice stuart smith finding against the applicant_ observed jurisdiction of the english court in respect of foreign states is governed by the state immunity act section provides state is immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the united kingdom except as provided in the following provisions of this part of this act the only relevant exception is section which provides state is not immune as respects proceedings in respect of death or personal injury caused by an act or omission in the united kingdom it is plain that the events in kuwait do not fall within the exception in section and the express words of section provide immunity to the first defendant despite this_ in what counsel for the plaintiff acknowledges is bold submission_ he contends that that section must be read subject to the implication that the state is only granted immunity if it is acting within the law of nations so that the section reads state acting within the law of nations is immune from jurisdiction except as provided the argument is that international law against torture is so fundamental that it is jus cogens_ or compelling law_ which overrides all other principles of international law_ including the well established principles of sovereign immunity no authority is cited for this proposition at common law_ sovereign state could not be sued at all against its will in the courts of this country the act_ by the exceptions therein set out_ marks substantial inroads into this principle it is inconceivable_ it seems to me_ that the draughtsman_ who must have been well aware of the various international agreements about torture_ intended section to be subject to an overriding qualification moreover_ authority in the united states at the highest level is completely contrary to counsel for the applicant submission lord justice stuart smith referred to the judgments of the united states courts_ argentine republic amerada hess shipping corporation and siderman de blake republic of argentina_ cited in paragraph below_ in both of which the court rejected the argument that there was an implied exception to the rule of state immunity where the state acted contrary to the law of nations counsel submits that we should not follow the highly persuasive judgments of the american courts cannot agree moment reflection is enough to show that the practical consequences of the plaintiff submission would be dire the courts in the united kingdom are open to all who seek their help_ whether they are british citizens or not vast number of people come to this country each year seeking refuge and asylum_ and many of these allege that they have been tortured in the country whence they came some of these claims are no doubt justified_ others are more doubtful those who are presently charged with the responsibility for deciding whether applicants are genuine refugees have difficult enough task_ but at least they know much of the background and surrounding circumstances against which the claim is made the court would be in no such position the foreign states would be unlikely to submit to the jurisdiction of the united kingdom court_ and in its absence the court would have no means of testing the claim or making just determination the other two members of the court of appeal_ lord justice ward and mr justice buckley_ also rejected the applicant claim lord justice ward commented that there may be no international forum other than the forum of the locus delicti to whom victim of torture will be understandably reluctant to turn where this terrible_ if established_ wrong can receive civil redress on november the applicant was refused leave to appeal by the house of lords his attempts to obtain compensation from the kuwaiti authorities via diplomatic channels have proved unsuccessful ii relevant legal materialsa jurisdiction of english courts in civil matters there is no rule under english law requiring plaintiff to be resident in the united kingdom or to be british national before the english courts can assert jurisdiction over civil wrongs committed abroad under the rules in force at the time the applicant issued proceedings_ the writ could be served outside the territorial jurisdiction with the leave of the court when the claim fell within one or more of the categories set out in order rule of the rules of the supreme court for present purposes only rule is relevant service of writ out of the jurisdiction is permissible with the leave of the court if_ in the action begun by the writ_ the claim is founded on tort and the damage was sustained_ or resulted from an act committed_ within the jurisdiction the state immunity act the relevant parts of the state immunity act provide state is immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the united kingdom except as provided in the following provisions of this part of this act state is not immune as regards proceedings in respect of death or personal injury caused by an act or omission in the united kingdom the basle convention the above provision section of the act was enacted to implement the european convention on state immunity the basle convention council of europe instrument_ which entered into force on june after its ratification by three states it has now been ratified by eight states austria_ belgium_ cyprus_ germany_ luxembourg_ the netherlands_ switzerland and the united kingdom and signed by one other state portugal article of the convention provides contracting state cannot claim immunity from the jurisdiction of court of another contracting state in proceedings which relate to redress for injury to the person or damage to tangible property_ if the facts which occasioned the injury or damage occurred in the territory of the state of forum_ and if the author of the injury or damage was present in that territory at the time when those facts occurred article of the basle convention provides that contracting state shall be entitled to immunity if the proceedings do not fall within the stated exceptions state immunity in respect of civil proceedings for torture in its report on jurisdictional immunities of states and their property the working group of the international law commission ilc found that over the preceding decade number of civil claims had been brought in municipal courts_ particularly in the united states and united kingdom_ against foreign governments_ arising out of acts of torture committed not in the territory of the forum state but in the territory of the defendant and other states the working group of the ilc found that national courts had in some cases shown sympathy for the argument that states are not entitled to plead immunity where there has been violation of human rights norms with the character of jus cogens_ although in most cases the plea of sovereign immunity had succeeded the working group cited the following cases in this connection united kingdom al adsani state of kuwait international law reports at new zealand controller and auditor general sir ronald davidson new zealand law reports particularly at per cooke dissenting opinion of justice wald in united states princz federal republic of germany dc cir at siderman de blake republic of argentina th cir argentine republic amerada hess shipping corporation us saudi arabia nelson international law reports the working group of the ilc did_ however_ note two recent developments which it considered gave support to the argument that state could not plead immunity in respect of gross human rights violations one of these was the house of lords judgment in ex parte pinochet no see paragraph below the other was the amendment by the united states of its foreign sovereign immunities act fsia to include new exception to immunity this exception_ introduced by section of the anti terrorism and effective death penalty act of applies in respect of claim for damages for personal injury or death caused by an act of torture_ extra judicial killing_ aircraft sabotage or hostage taking_ against state designated by the secretary of state as sponsor of terrorism_ where the claimant or victim was national of the united states at the time the act occurred in its judgment in flatow the islamic republic of iran and others supp the district court for the district of columbia confirmed that the property of foreign state was immune from attachment or execution_ unless the case fell within one of the statutory exceptions_ for example that the property was used for commercial activity the prohibition of torture in kuwait and under international law the kuwaiti constitution provides in article that no person shall be put to torture article of the universal declaration of human rights states no one shall be subjected to torture or cruel_ inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment article of the international covenant on civil and political rights states as relevant no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel_ inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment the united nations declaration on the protection of all persons from being subjected to torture and other cruel_ inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment provides in article that no state may permit or tolerate torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in the united nations convention against torture and other cruel_ inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment_ adopted on december the un convention torture is defined as for the purposes of this convention_ the term torture means any act by which severe pain or suffering_ whether physical or mental_ is intentionally inflicted on person for such purposes as obtaining from him or third person information or confession_ punishing him for an act he or third person has committed or is suspected of having committed or coercing him or third person_ or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind_ when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of public official or other person acting in an official capacity it does not include pain or suffering arising only from_ inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions the un convention requires by article that each state party is to take effective legislative_ administrative_ judicial or other measures to prevent torture in any territory under its jurisdiction_ and by article that all acts of torture be made offences under each state criminal law in its judgment in prosecutor furundzija december case no it t_ international legal materials the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia observed as follows it should be noted that the prohibition of torture laid down in human rights treaties enshrines an absolute right_ which can never be derogated from_ not even in time of emergency this is linked to the fact_ discussed below_ that the prohibition on torture is peremptory norm or jus cogens this prohibition is so extensive that states are even barred by international law from expelling_ returning or extraditing person to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture these treaty provisions impose upon states the obligation to prohibit and punish torture_ as well as to refrain from engaging in torture through their officials in international human rights law_ which deals with state responsibility rather than individual criminal responsibility_ torture is prohibited as criminal offence to be punished under national law in addition_ all states parties to the relevant treaties have been granted_ and are obliged to exercise_ jurisdiction to investigate_ prosecute and punish offenders the existence of this corpus of general and treaty rules proscribing torture shows that the international community_ aware of the importance of outlawing this heinous phenomenon_ has decided to suppress any manifestation of torture by operating both at the interstate level and at the level of individuals no legal loopholes have been left there exists today universal revulsion against torture this revulsion_ as well as the importance states attach to the eradication of torture_ has led to cluster of treaty and customary rules on torture acquiring particularly high status in the international_ normative system the prohibition of torture imposes on states obligations erga omnes_ that is_ obligations owed towards all the other members of the international community the other major feature of the principle proscribing torture relates to the hierarchy of rules in the international normative order because of the importance of the values it protects_ this principle has evolved into peremptory norm or jus cogens_ that is_ norm that enjoys higher rank in the international hierarchy than treaty law and even ordinary customary rules the most conspicuous consequence of this higher rank is that the principle at issue cannot be derogated from by states through international treaties or local or special or even general customary rules not endowed with the same normative force clearly the jus cogens nature of the prohibition against torture articulates the notion that the prohibition has now become one of the most fundamental standards of the international community similar statements were made in prosecutor delacic and others november case no it t_ and in prosecutor kunarac february case nos it and it criminal jurisdiction of the united kingdom over acts of torture the united kingdom ratified the un convention with effect from december section of the criminal justice act which entered into force on september made torture_ wherever committed_ criminal offence under united kingdom law triable in the united kingdom in its regina bow street metropolitan stipendiary magistrate and others_ ex parte pinochet ugarte no judgment of march appeal cases the house of lords held that the former president of chile_ senator pinochet_ could be extradited to spain in respect of charges which concerned conduct that was criminal in the united kingdom at the time when it was allegedly committed the majority of the law lords considered that torture did not become crime in the united kingdom until section of the criminal justice act came into effect the majority considered that although under part ii of the state immunity act former head of state enjoyed immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the united kingdom for acts done in his official capacity_ torture was an international crime and prohibited by jus cogens peremptory norms of international law the coming into force of the un convention see paragraph above had created universal criminal jurisdiction in all the contracting states in respect of acts of torture by public officials_ and the states parties could not have intended that an immunity for ex heads of state for official acts of torture would survive their ratification of the un convention the house of lords and_ in particular_ lord millett_ at made clear that their findings as to immunity ratione materiae from criminal jurisdiction did not affect the immunity ratione personae of foreign sovereign states from civil jurisdiction in respect of acts of torture

order to establish the facts_ the court based itself on documentary evidence_ the observations of the parties_ and the statements of the witnesses who gave evidence on the spot_ in chişinău and tiraspol in assessing the evidence for the purpose of establishing the facts_ the court considers that the following elements are relevant in assessing both written and oral evidence_ the court has hitherto generally applied beyond reasonable doubt as the standard of proof required such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong_ clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact in addition_ the conduct of the parties in relation to the court efforts to obtain evidence may constitute an element to be taken into account see_ mutatis mutandis_ ireland the united kingdom_ judgment of january series no pp and salman turkey gc no echr vii ii as regards the statements taken down by the delegates_ the court is aware of the difficulties that may arise in assessing such depositions obtained through interpreters it has therefore paid particular attention to the meaning and weight to be given to the witnesses statements to the delegates the court is likewise aware that large number of relevant facts concern events which took place more than ten years ago in an obscure and particularly complex context_ which makes some degree of imprecision about dates and other details inevitable it does not consider that that in itself can cast doubt on the credibility of the witness evidence iii in case where there are contradictory and opposing accounts of the facts_ the court is inevitably confronted with difficulties which any court of first instance is bound to meet when seeking to establish the facts_ regard being had_ for example_ to the fact that it does not have direct and detailed knowledge of the conditions obtaining in the region moreover_ the court has no powers to compel witnesses to appear in the present case_

taken down by the delegates show that large numbers of cossacks and other russian nationals went to transdniestria to fight alongside the separatists it further notes that the russian government have

that the mines had been laid by th army personnel_ but merely contended that logically work of such technical level could only have been carried out by professionals_ that is by th army troops it likewise notes that this witness asserted that the separatists had seized anti personnel mines previously held in the th army stores in the circumstances_ the court considers that this assertion is not certain beyond reasonable doubt and therefore cannot take it as established that it was th army or rog personnel who laid mines on the left bank of the dniester the moldovan government asserted that they had never claimed that the army of the russian federation had been legally stationed in moldovan territory_ or that the th army had not intervened in the transdniestrian conflict on the contrary_ they asserted_ as appeared from the witness evidence taken by the court delegates_ that the th army had intervened actively_ both directly and indirectly_ in the transdniestrian conflict_ against the armed forces of moldova the transdniestrian separatists had been able to arm themselves with weapons belonging to the th army and with the th army complicity the moldovan government considered that no faith could be placed in assertions that women had forcibly seized weapons and ammunition from the th army stores moreover_ not single russian soldier had subsequently been disciplined for negligence or complicity in the seizure of equipment from the th army stores the russian government argued that the th army had been in moldova when the transdniestrian conflict broke

against soldiers of the th army_ appropriate measures had been taken in accordance with international law in general_ the russian government were prepared to accept as hypothesis that individuals

observations they submitted throughout the proceedings as to the russian government allegation that the witnesses belonged to political circles opposed to the russian federation_ the court notes that this has not been substantiated moreover_ it is not possible for the court to determine precisely on the basis of the statements taken what the relative strengths of the combatants were however_ regard being had to the support given by the troops of the th army to the separatist forces and the massive transfer of arms and ammunition from the th army stores to the separatists_ it is certain

uncorroborated however_ the russian government have not denied the existence of such an office the court considers that in view of the special situation of the rog_ stationed in transdniestrian

confirmed the russian federation support for moldova in the transdniestrian conflict the rest of the item looked at various aspects of the transdniestrian economy_ presented as being wholly under the control of the smirnov family_ stating that its main source of income was the manufacture and export of arms to countries such as afghanistan_ pakistan_ iraq or chechnya the programme closed with the

on this point took place with representatives of the prosecution service of the mrt the supreme court of the mrt and the minister of justice of the mrt and with igor smirnov the applicants submitted to the court note verbale dated april to the moldovan embassy in moscow_ in which the ministry of foreign affairs of the russian federation drew the moldovan government attention to the fact that the memorial they had filed with the european court of human rights in october gave subjective assessment of russia role in the case of the ilaşcu group and in no way reflected the friendly character of relations between the republic of moldova and the russian federation the note continued examination of the memorial by the grand chamber of the european court_ due to take place on may of this year_ may cause serious prejudice to the interests of the russian federation and moldova in that context_ the russian side_ relying on the agreement reached by the heads of the diplomatic services of the two countries with regard to the need to withdraw the memorial concerned_ urges the government of moldova to take all the necessary steps to ensure the withdrawal of this document before april and to inform the european court and russia representative to that organ of the fact officially mr ilaşcu release on may mr ilaşcu said that at about on may vladimir chevtsov_ also known as antiufeyev_ the transdniestrian minister of security entered his cell and told him to get dressed quickly because he was to be presented to the president of the mrt the applicant left all his personal effects in the

follows the prisoner ilaşcu_ who has been sentenced to death_ is transferred to the competent organs of the republic of moldova after handing over this document_ mr chevtsov allegedly declared that the sentence remained valid and would be enforced if mr ilaşcu returned to transdniestria moldovan special forces then took the applicant to the ministry of security_ where he was questioned briefly before being released on june the moldovan government informed the court that the president of the republic of moldova_ mr voronin_ had learned of mr ilaşcu release from letter sent to him by mr smirnov on may in that letter_ mr smirnov requested that in return for the transdniestrian authorities gesture_ the republic of moldova should condemn its aggression against the transdniestrian people make full reparation for the pecuniary damage sustained by the mrt as result of the aggression_ and present its apologies to the transdniestrian people for the pain and suffering caused in letter of november the moldovan government submitted to the court copies of several decrees signed by mr smirnov_ the president of the mrt decree no signed on july provided for moratorium on enforcement of the death penalty within the territory of the mrt from september this moratorium was apparently also applicable to judgments rendered before that date_ but not enforced by the time of the decree entry into force_ which was to coincide with its signature and publication in the official gazette decree no signed by mr smirnov on may granted pardon to mr ilaşcu and ordered his release the decree came into force on the day of its signature the moldovan government made no comment on the subject of mr ilaşcu alleged transfer_ but merely submitted to the court mr smirnov decree concerning the applicant nor did they comment on the decree authenticity they added nevertheless that they had heard rumours to the effect that_ before signing the decree in question_ mr smirnov had commuted the death sentence imposed on mr ilaşcu to one of life imprisonment mr ilaşcu asserted that mr smirnov decree was forgery created after his release he maintained that_ in spite of his release_ his conviction remained valid and that if he returned to transdniestria he would be liable to the death sentence the court has only the allegations of mr ilaşcu_ copy of mr smirnov decree of may and the moldovan government assertions of commutation of the sentence none of these different accounts is corroborated by other evidence and the court can see no objective element capable of persuading it to accept one version rather than another consequently_ the court considers that as the evidence before it stands at present_ it is not able to reach conclusion as to the reasons and legal basis for mr ilaşcu release steps taken after may to secure the other applicants release after mr ilaşcu release_ the representative of mr leşco submitted in letter received by the court on june that this release had been prompted by the russian authorities intercession with the transdniestrian authorities he asserted that_ in an interview given to the moldovan public radio station radio moldova_ the moldovan minister for foreign affairs_ mr nicolae chernomaz_ had stated ilie ilaşcu was released following the intervention of the russian minister for foreign affairs_ igor ivanov_ who_ at the request of moldova president voronin_ spoke to the tiraspol authorities on this subject over the telephone he explained to them that this is an international problem affecting the honour of the russian federation and moldova mr chernomaz apparently went on to say that he had met mr ivanov to try to convince him that the application to the european court of human rights could not be withdrawn because mr ilaşcu was prisoner of conscience_ hostage of the conflict at the hearing on june the moldovan government thanked those who had contributed to mr ilaşcu release_ in particular the russian federation_ and stated that they wished to modify the position they had previously adopted in the observations of october particularly as regards the responsibility of the russian federation they explained this decision by their desire to avoid undesirable consequences_ such as tension or the end of the process aimed at finding peaceful solution to the transdniestrian dispute and securing the release of the other applicants after mr ilaşcu release_ meetings between him and the moldovan authorities took place to discuss the prospects for the release of the other applicants at press conference which he gave on july the president of moldova_ mr voronin_ declared mr ilaşcu is the person who is keeping his comrades detained in tiraspol he pointed out in that connection that he had suggested to mr ilaşcu that he should withdraw his application to the court against the russian federation and moldova_ in exchange for which the other applicants would be released before june but that mr ilaşcu had refused to do so according to the moldovan press agency basa press_ mr voronin also suggested that if mr ilaşcu won his case before the court that would make the release of the other applicants more difficult international reactions to the applicants conviction and detention in report of february written at the request of the osce office for democratic institutions and human

this_ however_ would have to be collected from the occupied areas unficyp sr said that unficyp was ready to provide help but suggested_ acknowledging the difficulties_ that it might be better for the two sides to be in direct contact with each other and to exchange information the cypriot authorities had informed him that this was not possible as the cypriot police could not have direct contact with the trnc police and that it was for this reason they had sought unficyp intervention internal note by the cypriot police dated january according to this note_ meeting was held on that day at unficyp headquarters in nicosia on the initiative of the spa between the spa and the assistant of the cypriot chief of police the spa stated that she had had_ on the same day_ long meeting concerning

had been made in turkey she had also informed him that five arrest warrants had been issued by cypriot court against the suspects_ four of whom were detained in trnc prisons she had expressed her concerns that if the suspects were released they might leave the trnc and their future arrest would not be possible the trnc chief of police had informed her that these suspects had been detained for minor offences car theft and that it was possible that their detention would not be extended by the judge although the trnc authorities would try to have their detention extended_ they had no evidence to charge them with murder although the suspects had already been questioned about the murders and had given some information_ this was not enough no voluntary statements had been made the trnc chief of police had also told her that he was aware that the cypriot police did not have enough evidence and that only if the two police forces cooperated could more evidence be collected he had also asked

facilitate cooperation without any political ramifications προεκτάσεις unficyp liaison officer had asked if there was possibility that turkey could be involved_ so that the suspects could be extradited to turkey and from there to the republic of cyprus the trnc chief of police had answered in the negative it appeared that the trnc authorities had already examined the matter but could not take such action as it was not provided for by their legislation the trnc chief of police had suggested that the cypriot police hand over the evidence to the trnc police so that the latter could arrest and try the suspects if the cypriot police informed their authorities officially about the evidence and exhibits in respect of the case and officially requested the extradition of the suspects_ the trnc authorities could cooperate and possibly extradite them one of the suspects was in turkey but appeared not to be connected to the murders the trnc authorities also had information in their possession linking other persons to the murders according to the spa the trnc authorities were sincere and wished to cooperate they had mentioned_ inter alia_ their concerns that there could be more

provide advice as to how the cypriot government should act and to sit in any negotiations in order to see how unficyp could intervene so as to help investigate εξιχνιαστει the murders the spa had asked the cypriot authorities whether interpol could intervene as she considered it unfair that_ although the perpetrators of an atrocious crime had been identified_ they remained free because of political problem the trnc police had requested to be kept informed by the united nations un of developments in the case and she had promised that they would be from the minutes of meeting on january

according to the constitution of cyprus article any case confined among turkish cypriots should be taken by the turkish cypriot courts in the case of murder of elmas güzelyurtlu and his family_ all

successfully by the greek cypriot police_ cooperation is needed for the justice to be done this is an urgent situation therefore we need to act together immediately as first step the report concerning the dna analysis is needed to get the court order to have the suspects in custody during the lawsuit this is humanitarian issue and totally out of political concerns the political concerns should not

consented to such meeting according to the trnc chief of police_ there might be more suspects and the first applicant had given inaccurate information to the cypriot police_ including the wrong photo

hearing could take place there the head of consular affairs stated that the trnc authorities were not planning to take any steps until the evidence and records were handed over to them because it was unacceptable to the trnc authorities for the cypriot authorities to work alone on this matter from the minutes of meeting on april turkey on april unficyp officials had general meeting with the trnc

police_ the police of the british sovereign bases and the trnc police be held at technical services level in the mixed village of pyla_ which is located in the un buffer zone the cypriot chief of police had rejected this as constituting move towards recognising pseudo state which provided refuge to fugitives he sought to obtain the cypriot government political position regarding this suggestion note by the cypriot police to the chief of police dated may this note stated that at meeting held the day before between the spa_ the dspa and members of the cypriot police and investigation team_ the dspa had raised his concerns about an increased level of collaboration between greek cypriot and turkish cypriot criminals and their movements across the island he had also enquired whether the cypriot police intended to give the evidence to unficyp for it to be forwarded to the trnc authorities in order to enable the suspects prosecution the cypriot police could make the necessary arrangements for the suspects to be taken to unficyp building at the ledra palace hotel in the buffer zone and be questioned through the video recording interview method and if this was possible whether such evidence would be admissible before cypriot court if one of the suspects were to come over to make statement against the other suspects_ the cypriot authorities would arrest him and bring criminal proceedings against him the cypriot police had informed the dspa that they would cooperate with unficyp but not with the trnc authorities or police they had also informed him that prosecution decisions were made by the attorney general they had highlighted the fact that_ despite the red notices_ turkey had refused to cooperate and had not surrendered the fifth suspect_ who had gone to turkey they had arrested him but subsequently released him the dspa had stated that the trnc pursuant to its own laws could not surrender turkish cypriots it had been stressed by the police chief superintendent that the trnc was not state the dspa had also put forward the suggestion that the suspects could be surrendered to third country such as greece_ and that steps to bring them to justice could be taken from there the police chief superintendent had informed him that this was not an option and that turkey had an obligation to comply with international law finally_ the dspa had suggested that the matter could be discussed by the relevant technical committee in order to avoid the issue taking on political dimension_ to find solutions for cooperation and to bring the perpetrators to justice he had been informed that this was sensitive matter and that the political aspects could not be ignored if the pseudo state authorities were interested in completing the investigation and bringing the perpetrators to justice_ they should stop providing refuge to criminals internal note about meeting on june between unficyp and the cypriot police cyprus this note stated that at this meeting_ the dspa had noted that he was trying to convince the trnc authorities to surrender the suspects the cypriot police had informed him that they would not be providing any evidence to_ or cooperating with_ the authorities of the pseudo state but that they were willing to cooperate with unficyp without this implying any recognition of an illegal entity email dated october sent by the dspa to the applicants representative in an email sent by the dspa to the applicants representative_ mrs meleagrou on october the following_ inter alia_ was stated note your request and assure you of the un utmost cooperation in dealing with any matter of criminal nature_ particularly in this most serious case while unficyp has been exhausting its efforts to reach some conclusion to this case_ it is unfortunate that there is stalemate at this present time due to the two sides not agreeing on way forward note your comments that the republic of cyprus will hand over to the un in cyprus all the evidence on the suspects so that the un legal team can evaluate the evidence and see whether or not there is prima facie case against them the republic of cyprus will only do so if the trnc authorities give an undertaking that they will hand the suspects over to the republic of cyprus to be tried if the un is satisfied possibly after discussion with the trnc the italicised parenthesis is not strictly speaking part of the proposal at this stage but might be what we will have to argue in order to facilitate matters that there is such prima facie case against the suspects the republic of cyprus will not hand over any evidence for the purposes of conducting trial in the north this is despite the fact that an other jurisdiction united kingdom has in the past successfully caused trial to be conducted in the north in respect of serious crime committed in the uk the legal processes conducted in the north do not allow for the handing over of any turkish cypriot suspects to any authorities in the south or any other country in any other circumstances therefore unficyp stands ready to facilitate in any way it can in this case_ can see no resolution being arrived at until such time as one side or the other cedes their current position either the republic of cyprus is willing to hand over all the evidence to the north and offer full police and evidentiary cooperation so that trial can be conducted in that jurisdiction or the north is willing to hand over suspects on the basis of sufficient evidence to cause the issuance of an arrest warrant in the north_ with view to handling the suspects to unficyp for passing on the republic of cyprus as always unficyp stands ready to cooperate in whatever manner it can email dated november sent by unficyp to the applicants representative in an email sent by unficyp to the applicants representative mrs meleagrou on november the following was stated as stated in my previous email to you unficyp stands ready to facilitate negotiations between the two sides in respect of this matter and indeed continues in its efforts to find solution however_ unficyp is not in position to formally engage suitably qualified expert to officially adjudicate on the evidence held by the republic of cyprus it has already been stated that while the unficyp believes that there is enough evidence on face value for the two sides to reach suitable position_ it welcomes the delivery of any further or all evidence_ copies or otherwise_ from the republic of cyprus that can be used to further meaningful dialogue between the two sides again reiterate the following options that may in my view facilitate further useful negotiations the republic of cyprus without prejudice_ should deliver to the unficyp all necessary evidence_ allowing this to be used as unficyp sees fit_ with view to negotiating the alleged offenders arrest and handover to unficyp for delivery to the authorities in the south for the purposes of trial however_ without clear guarantee that the north will arrest and hand over the alleged offenders there is little chance of this being successful the only other solution is for the republic of cyprus to hand over all the evidence to unficyp for delivery to the relevant persons in the north with view to having trial conducted in the north this option has already been rejected by the republic of cyprus other relevant documents the un secretary general reports on the un operation in cyprus the relevant parts of the un secretary general reports on the un operation in cyprus are set out below report of may official contact between the sides is hampered by high degree of mistrust on january three members of turkish cypriot family living in the south were killed eight suspects were arrested in the north while all the evidence remained in the south unficyp efforts to assist the sides to bring the suspects to justice proved unsuccessful_ and all suspects were released in the north this case is an illustration of the growing number of crimes across the cease fire line_ such as smuggling_ drug trafficking_ illegal immigration and human trafficking these problems are implicit in the expanding inter communal contacts_ which though positive_ have also the potential for adverse consequences if the present lack of cooperation between the sides persists the continuing absence of official contacts between the sides has accentuated unficyp role in promoting bicommunal contacts although people from either side can meet freely since the opening of the crossings in the impartiality of the ledra palace hotel venue and the united nations umbrella are considered indispensable for sensitive humanitarian and other meetings_ including those of political parties from the north and the south it is hoped that under the auspices of unficyp_ contacts may be established between the sides_ without prejudice to their political positions_ on humanitarian and related issues generating climate of trust and easing tensions during the reporting period_ unficyp provided facilities for bicommunal events_ including those implemented by the united nations development programme

offences are being taken against the suspected person in the requested state if it considers that transfer of the proceedings is warranted in the interests of arriving at the truth and in particular that the most important items of evidence are located in the requested state if it considers that the enforcement in the requested state of sentence if one were passed is likely to improve the prospects for the social rehabilitation of the person sentenced if it considers that the presence of the suspected person cannot be ensured at the hearing of proceedings in the requesting state and that his presence in person at the hearing of proceedings in the requested state can be ensured if it considers that it could not itself enforce sentence if one were passed_ even by having recourse to extradition_ and that the requested state could do so the principle of non recognition the international law commission ilc at its fifty third session_ in adopted set of draft articles on responsibility of states for internationally wrongful acts this text was submitted to the united nations general assembly_ which took note of it resolution res of december the following articles are of particular interest chapter iiiserious breaches of obligations under peremptory norms of general international lawarticle application of this chapter this chapter applies to the international responsibility which is entailed by serious breach by state of an obligation arising under peremptory norm of general international law breach of such an obligation is serious if it involves gross or systematic failure by the responsible state to fulfil the obligation article particular consequences of serious breach of an obligation under this chapter states shall cooperate to bring to an end through lawful means any serious breach within the meaning of article no state shall recognize as lawful situation created by serious breach within the meaning of article nor render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation in its commentary to draft article the ilc observed in particular as follows footnotes omitted pursuant to paragraph of article states are under duty of abstention_ which comprises two obligations_ first_ not to recognize as lawful situations created by serious breaches in the sense of article and_ secondly_ not to render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation the first of these two obligations refers to the obligation of collective non recognition by the international community as whole of the legality of situations resulting directly from serious breaches in the sense of article it not only refers to the formal recognition of these situations_ but also prohibits acts which would imply such recognition the existence of an obligation of non recognition in response to serious breaches of obligations arising under peremptory norms already finds support in international practice and in decisions of the icj international court of justice the principle that territorial acquisitions brought about by the use of force are not valid and must not be recognized found clear expression during the manchurian crisis of an example of the practice of non recognition of acts in breach of peremptory norms is provided by the reaction of the security council to the iraqi invasion of kuwait in following the iraqi declaration of comprehensive and eternal merger with kuwait_ the security council_ in resolution of august decided that the annexation had no legal validity_ and is considered null and void and called upon all states_ international organizations and specialized agencies not to recognize that annexation and to refrain from any action or dealing that might be interpreted as recognition of it_ whether direct or indirect under article paragraph no state shall recognize the situation created by the serious breach as lawful this obligation applies to all states_ including the responsible state similar considerations apply even to the injured state since the breach by definition concerns the international community as whole_ waiver or recognition induced from the injured state by the responsible state cannot preclude the international community interest in ensuring just and appropriate settlement the consequences of the obligation of non recognition are_ however_ not unqualified in the namibia advisory opinion the court international court of justice despite holding that the illegality of the situation was opposable erga omnes and could not be recognized as lawful even by states not members of the united nations_ said that the non recognition of south africa administration of the territory should not result in depriving the people of namibia of any advantages derived from international cooperation in particular_ while official acts performed by the government of south africa on behalf of or concerning namibia after the termination of the mandate are illegal and invalid_ this invalidity cannot be extended to those acts_ such as_ for instance_ the registration of births_ deaths and marriages_ the effects of which can be ignored only to the detriment of the inhabitants of the territory both the principle of non recognition and this qualification to it have been applied_ for example_ by the european court of human rights the second obligation contained in paragraph prohibits states from rendering aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by serious breach in the sense of article it deals with conduct after the fact which assists the responsible state in maintaining situation opposable to all states in the sense of barring erga omnes the legality of situation which is maintained in violation of international law in some respects_ the prohibition contained in paragraph may be seen as logical extension of the duty of non recognition however_ it has separate scope of application insofar as actions are concerned which would not imply recognition of the situation created by serious breaches in the sense of article the international response to the establishment of the trnc on november in response to the proclamation of the establishment of the trnc the united nations security council adopted resolution which provides_ where relevant_ as follows the security council deplores the declaration of the turkish cypriot authorities of the purported secession of part of the republic of cyprus considers the declaration as legally invalid and calls for its withdrawal calls upon all states to respect the sovereignty_ independence_ territorial integrity and non alignment of the republic of cyprus calls upon all states not to recognise any cypriot state other than the republic of cyprus resolution adopted on may in response to the exchange of ambassadors between turkey and the trnc stated_ inter alia_ as follows the security council reaffirms its resolution and calls for its urgent and effective implementation condemns all secessionist actions_ including the purported exchange of ambassadors between turkey and the turkish cypriot leadership_ declares them illegal and invalid and calls for their immediate withdrawal reiterates the call upon all states not to recognise the purported state of the turkish republic of northern cyprus set up by secessionist acts and calls upon them not to facilitate or in any way assist the aforesaid secessionist entity calls upon all states to respect the sovereignty_ independence_ territorial integrity_ unity and non alignment of the republic of cyprus in november the committee of ministers of the council of europe decided that it continued to regard the government of the republic of cyprus as the sole legitimate government of cyprus and called for respect for the sovereignty_ independence_ territorial integrity and unity of the republic of cyprus see loizidou turkey merits december reports of judgments and decisions vi iv relevant comparative law material the court has considered it appropriate to conduct comparative survey with regard to two sets of questions_ namely extradition on the one hand_ and other forms of cooperation in criminal matters on the other the survey takes into account the domestic law of forty five contracting parties to the convention other than cyprus and turkey albania_ andorra_ armenia_ austria_ azerbaijan_ belgium_ bosnia and herzegovina_ bulgaria_ croatia_ the czech republic_ denmark_ estonia_ finland_ france_ georgia_ germany_ greece_ hungary_ iceland_ ireland_ italy_ latvia_ liechtenstein_ lithuania_ luxembourg_ malta_ moldova_ monaco_ montenegro_ the netherlands_ norway_ poland_ portugal_ romania_ russia_ san marino_ serbia_ slovakia_ slovenia_ spain_ sweden_ switzerland_ the former yugoslav republic of macedonia_ ukraine and the united kingdom extradition it would appear that national laws generally provide for the possibility rather than an obligation to do so of extraditing suspect to state where the offence at issue has been committed moreover_ extradition becomes possible only when certain statutory conditions are satisfied_ such as double criminality and the minimum severity of the sentence it is also common for national laws to lay down conditions under which extradition must or may be refused in number of states these conditions include situations where the crime in question is also subject to the jurisdiction of the requested state or the latter has already instituted proceedings in respect of the same acts this is the position_ for example_ in austria_ bulgaria_ greece_ liechtenstein_ monaco_ poland_ slovenia and switzerland the laws of some states make it expressly clear that_ even when all the legal conditions for the extradition are satisfied_ the final decision by the executive power includes the consideration of the state interests_ and is thus of political and discretionary nature this is the case in particular in austria_ the czech republic_ estonia_ france_ germany_ hungary_ italy_ liechtenstein_ romania and slovakia in contrast to the discretionary approach adopted by the overwhelming majority of states_ it appears that under irish and united kingdom law extradition must be ordered if the relevant statutory conditions are met_ although this requirement applies to countries specified in the law or with which there are extradition agreements the generally discretionary nature of an extradition decision under domestic law can be subject to exceptions arising from provisions of an international treaty_ whether multilateral or bilateral the council of europe european convention on extradition as regards nationals_ forty two out of the forty five member states of the council of europe surveyed ban their extradition as general rule only denmark_ malta and the united kingdom do not bar_ as matter of principle_ the extradition of their nationals the rule prohibiting the extradition of nationals is enshrined in the constitution of at least eighteen member states armenia_ azerbaijan_ croatia_ estonia_ georgia_ germany_ italy_ latvia_ lithuania_ moldova_ montenegro_ poland_ portugal_ romania_ russia_ slovenia_ the former yugoslav republic of macedonia and ukraine the rule is also of constitutional nature in austria however_ it appears that only five member states azerbaijan_ moldova_ monaco_ russia and ukraine apply the ban on extradition of nationals in all circumstances_ without exception the rest allow extradition of nationals under certain conditions consent of the person requested or on the basis of an international treaty it appears that only two member states hungary and romania have in their laws specific rules authorising the extradition of nationals who also have the nationality of another state in the remaining states those which prohibit extradition of nationals those with double nationality are also protected by the principle of non extradition other forms of cooperation in criminal matters mutual assistance and transfer of proceedings number of member states belgium_ estonia_ georgia_ ireland_ luxembourg_ moldova_ sweden and the united kingdom provide in their legislation for the possibility of denying mutual assistance request if the execution of the request would prejudice the essential interests of the state the possibility or even the obligation to refuse legal assistance in case of ongoing domestic proceedings concerning the same facts is provided for in the law of many other states_ including azerbaijan_ croatia_ the netherlands_ poland_ romania_ the former yugoslav republic of macedonia and ukraine in number of member states it is also possible but not mandatory to transfer the proceedings or criminal files to state to which the suspect has fled_ especially if the suspect is foreign national or is resident of that state

patrolling the land border and the coast to prevent illegal entry mass attempts to breach the border fences are organised on regular basis groups generally comprising several hundred aliens_ many of them from sub saharan africa_ attempt to enter spanish territory by storming the fences described above they frequently operate at night in order to produce surprise effect and increase their chances of success those migrants who do not manage to evade the guardia civil_ and whom the officials succeed in persuading to come down of their own accord using ladders_ are taken back immediately to morocco and handed over to the moroccan authorities_ unless they are in need of medical treatment see paragraph below at the time of the events this modus operandi was provided for only by the guardia

around migrants from scaling the outer fence_ but around hundred migrants nevertheless succeeded approximately seventy five migrants managed to reach the top of the inner fence_ but only few came down the other side and landed on spanish soil_ where they were met by the members of the guardia civil the others remained sitting on top of the inner fence the guardia civil officials helped them to climb down with the aid of ladders_ before escorting them back to moroccan territory on the other side of the border through the gates between the fences the first applicant stated that he had managed to reach the top of the inner fence and had remained there until the afternoon the second applicant said that he had been struck by stone while he was climbing the outer fence and had fallen_ but had subsequently managed to get to the top of the inner fence_ where he had remained for eight hours at around and respectively the first and second applicants reportedly climbed down from the fence with the help of spanish law enforcement officials who provided them with ladders as soon as they reached the ground they were allegedly apprehended by guardia civil officials who handcuffed them_ took them back to morocco and handed them over to the moroccan authorities the applicants alleged that they had not undergone any identification procedure and had had no opportunity to explain their personal circumstances or to be assisted by lawyers or interpreters the applicants were then reportedly transferred to nador police station_ where they requested medical assistance their request was

lodged an application for international protection his application was rejected on march on the grounds that it was unfounded and that the applicant was not at risk_ as the unhcr office had issued an opinion on march finding that the first applicant circumstances did not justify granting him international protection request for review lodged by the applicant was rejected by decision of the interior ministry asylum and refugees office on march following further negative unhcr opinion issued on the same day the stay of the administrative expulsion proceedings was therefore lifted and the first applicant was sent back to mali by airplane on march the previous day an appeal against the decision refusing international protection had been lodged with the administrative courts_ but was

applicable at the relevant time which introduced the term operational border the parts of the border control operations protocol of relevance to the present case read as follows with this system of fences_ there is an objective need to determine when illegal entry has failed and when it has taken place this requires defining the line which delimits the national territory_ for the sole purpose of the rules governing aliens_ line which takes the physical form of the fence in question hence_ where attempts by migrants to cross this line illegally are contained and repelled by the law enforcement agencies responsible for controlling the border_ no actual illegal entry is deemed to have taken place entry is deemed to have been effected only where migrant has penetrated beyond the above mentioned internal fence_ thereby entering the national territory and coming within the scope of the rules governing aliens circular letter to all spanish ambassadors the relevant parts of this circular read as follows law no of october on asylum and subsidiary protection_ published in the official gazette on saturday october section of this law concerns persons applying for international protection in embassies and consulates the key elements of this section are as follows this section is not applicable if the person concerned is national of the country where the diplomatic representation is located in addition_ his or her physical integrity must be at risk from causes linked to the scope of application of the law asylum or subsidiary protection it is the task of spanish ambassadors but under no circumstances of consuls to facilitate where appropriate the transfer of the asylum seeker or asylum seekers to spain for the sole purpose of submitting the asylum claim in accordance with the procedure laid down by this law that is to say_ in spain this authority lies with the ambassadors alone at all events neither ambassadors nor consuls are authorised by law to take decision on applications for asylum or protection_ still less to inform spain thereof this is crucial if such decision were to be taken_ the spanish state would be obliged to provide the asylum seeker with legal assistance and protection including against refoulement from the country and to meet his or her needs in terms of food and housing including healthcare needs section makes no provision for this consequently_ the fact that someone seeks to lodge an asylum application with an embassy or consulate does not in any circumstances entail the start of procedure for possible admission this does not prevent the ambassador_ if he or she has determined that the conditions set out above are satisfied in given case_ from confirming the actual nationality of the person concerned and verifying whether his or her physical safety is at risk in the manner described above every effort must be made to obtain as much information as possible and to compile full records of the case and the allegations made by the potential applicant for asylum or protection these are to be sent to the directorate of consular affairs and migration so that the supervisory authority can take cognisance of them_ assess them and take decision in sum_ if in the exercise of his or her duties the ambassador considers that there is risk to the asylum seeker physical integrity he or she may secure the person transfer to spain this may entail issuing visa and one way airline ticket to spain_ subject to prior approval by the ministry the second sub section of section provides for the adoption of implementing regulations_ to be drawn up jointly by the ministries of the interior_ justice and foreign affairs these regulations will lay down the procedure enabling ambassadors to assess the issue of possible transfer to spain with regard to proceedings already in progress_ the first transitional provision provides_ where relevant_ for application of the rules in force prior to the entry into force of the new law which will apply as of today_ november for new cases_ and until such time as the implementing rules for the law_ referred to in the second sub section of section enter into force_ you should follow the instructions set out in this circular madrid_ november the spanish ombudsperson office in his annual report_ the spanish ombudsperson wrote as follows as regards the issue whether the border zone should be regarded as spanish territory and_ accordingly_ which rules are applicable to it_ it can be asserted_ in the light of the various conventions signed during the nineteenth century between spain and morocco defining the jurisdictional limits of the autonomous city of melilla_ that the zone is constructed on spanish territory_ that spain has full ownership of the area in question and that it is controlled by the spanish law enforcement agencies it is therefore not for the spanish administrative authorities to determine where our country legislation should start to apply that territorial application is governed by international treaties or_ where applicable_ by international custom_ which define the borders with neighbouring states in presenting her annual report to the senate on april the spanish ombudsperson deplored the heart rending images of people who had climbed to the top of the fences and stressed that once person was on spanish territory as we believe to be the case when he or she is on the fences of the melilla border he or she should be dealt with in accordance with the law in force the ombudsperson therefore condemned the

ec of the european parliament and of the council of december on common standards and procedures in member states for returning illegally staying third country nationals the return directive the text of the directive the relevant provisions of the return directive read as follows article object this directive sets out common standards and procedures to be applied in member states for returning illegally staying third country nationals_ in accordance with fundamental rights as general principles of community law as well as international law_ including refugee protection and human rights obligations article scope this directive applies to third country nationals staying illegally on the territory of member state member states may decide not to apply this directive to third country

irregular crossing by land_ sea or air of the external border of member state and who have not subsequently obtained an authorisation or right to stay in that member state article more favourable

necessary_ linguistic assistance member states shall ensure that the necessary legal assistance and or representation is granted on request free of charge in accordance with relevant national

the cjeu in relation to this directive the principles established by the case law of the court of justice of the european union the cjeu concerning the right to be heard under the return directive are set out in detail in the judgment in khlaifia and others cited above_ in recent ruling judgment of june affum_ the cjeu clarified the interpretation to be given to article of that directive_ stating that it concerned third country nationals who had been apprehended or intercepted by the competent authorities at the very time of the irregular crossing of the border or near that border after it had been so crossed the relevant paragraphs of the judgment read as follows finally_ still in relation to that second situation_ article of directive specifies that the apprehension or interception of the third country nationals concerned must take place in connection with the irregular crossing of an external border_ which_ as ms affum_ the greek government and the commission submit in essence_ and as the advocate general has observed in point of his opinion_ implies direct temporal and spatial link with that crossing of the border that situation therefore concerns third country nationals who have been apprehended or intercepted by the competent authorities at the very time of the irregular crossing of the border or near that border after it has been so crossed in the second place_ it is to be noted that the exception provided for in article of directive unlike the exception provided for in article is coupled with certain obligations which are set out in article of the directive the fact that article of directive thus regulates in detail the exercise by the member states of the power provided for in article of the directive can be explained_ as the commission set out at the hearing_ by the purpose of article as apparent from the directive history_ of permitting the member states to continue to apply simplified national return procedures at their external borders_ without having to follow all the procedural stages prescribed by the directive_ in order to be able to remove more swiftly third country nationals intercepted when crossing those borders article of directive is intended in that context to ensure that those simplified national procedures observe the minimum guarantees prescribed by the directive_ which include_ in particular_ the detention conditions laid down in articles and the cjeu has also defined the expression irregular crossing of border as crossing that does not fulfil the conditions imposed by the legislation applicable in the member state in question and which must necessarily be considered irregular within the meaning of article of the dublin iii regulation judgment of july jafari_ et seq the cjeu judgment of march in arib is also interesting in this regard as it reiterates that_ according to the cjeu case law_ the two situations covered by article of directive relate exclusively to the crossing of member state external border_ as defined in article of the schengen borders code_ and do not concern the crossing of common border of member states forming part of the schengen area see affum_ cited above_ council directive ec of

persons as beneficiaries of international protection_ for uniform status for refugees or for persons eligible for subsidiary protection_ and for the content of the protection granted recast the relevant provisions of directive eu read as follows article revocation of_ ending of or refusal to renew refugee status member states may revoke_ end or refuse to renew the status granted to refugee by governmental_ administrative_ judicial or quasi judicial body_ when there are reasonable grounds for regarding him or her as danger to the security of the member state in which he or she is present he or she_ having been convicted by final judgment of particularly serious crime_ constitutes danger to the community of that member state in situations described in paragraph member states may decide not to grant status to refugee_ where such decision has not yet been taken in its judgment of may and ministerstvo vnitra and others the cjeu clarified the interpretation of the terms refugee and refugee status for the purposes of article and article respectively of this directive and also_ among other points_ the material conditions required in order for third country national or stateless person to be regarded as refugee the relevant paragraphs of the cjeu judgment read as follows it should be noted that_ regarding the term refugee article of that directive reproduces_ in essence_ the definition set out in article of the geneva convention in that regard_ the provisions of chapter iii of directive entitled qualification for being refugee provide clarification regarding the material conditions necessary to enable third country national or stateless person to be considered refugee for the purposes of article of that directive for its part_ article of directive defines refugee status as the recognition by member state of third country national or stateless person as refugee as can be seen from recital of that directive_ that recognition is declaratory and not constitutive of being refugee the fact that being refugee for the purposes of article of directive and article of the geneva convention is not dependent on formal recognition thereof through the granting of refugee status as defined in article of that directive is_ moreover_ borne out by the wording of article of that directive_ which states that refugee may_ in accordance with the condition laid down in that provision_ be refouled whether formally recognised or not thus_ where the refoulement of refugee covered by one of the scenarios referred to in article and and article of directive would expose that refugee to the risk of his fundamental rights_ as enshrined in article and article of the charter_ being infringed_ the member state concerned may not derogate from the principle of non refoulement under article of the geneva convention it must therefore be held that member states_ when implementing article or of that directive_ are_ in principle_ required to grant refugees who are present in their respective territories only the rights expressly referred to in article of that directive and the rights set out in the geneva convention that are guaranteed for any refugee who is present in the territory of contracting state and do not require lawful stay european parliament resolution of april on the situation in the mediterranean and the need for holistic eu approach to migration ini the relevant parts of this resolution read as follows the european parliament_ recalls that_ since the establishment of the schengen area_ the union is an area without internal borders_ that the schengen member states have developed step by step common policy towards the schengen external borders_ and that the inherent logic of such system has always been that the abolition of internal border controls has to go hand in hand with compensatory measures strengthening the external borders of the schengen area and the sharing of information through the schengen information system sis acknowledges that the integrity of the schengen area and the abolition of internal border controls are dependent on having effective management of external borders_ with high common standards applied by all member states at the external borders and an effective exchange of information between them accepts that the union needs to strengthen its external border protection and further develop the ceas and that measures are necessary to enhance the capacity of the schengen area to address the new challenges facing europe and preserve the fundamental principles of security and free movement of persons points out that access to the territory of the schengen area is generally controlled at the external border under the schengen borders code and that_ in addition_ citizens of many third countries require visa to enter the schengen area reiterates the unhcr call that respect for fundamental rights and international obligations can only be ensured if operating procedures and plans reflect those obligations in practical_ clear guidance to border personnel_ including those at land_ sea and air borders points out to the need to further strengthen the union civil protection mechanism in order to respond to events with wide ranging impacts which affect significant number of member states emphasises again that_ as for legislation specifically in the area of asylum and migration_ in order for legislation on internal and external borders to be effective_ it is essential that measures agreed at union level are implemented properly by the member states underlines that better implementation of measures by member states at the external borders_ following increased pressure_ is essential and will go some way towards allaying the security fears of citizens considers that the schengen area is one of the major achievements of european integration notes that the conflict in syria and other conflicts elsewhere in the region have triggered record numbers of refugees and migrants arriving in the union_ which in turn has revealed deficiencies at parts of the union external borders is concerned at the fact that_ in response_ some member states

examine certain aspects of the treatment of irregular migrants intercepted along the border with morocco_ in the melilla enclave in its report published on april the cpt found as follows the cpt acknowledges that number of european states have to cope with frequent influxes of irregular migrants it is notably the case for those countries situated at the external frontiers of the european union which act as the gateway to the rest of europe spain is one of these countries facing such pressures the autonomous municipality of melilla is spanish exclave of km² located on the northern coast of africa_ surrounded by moroccan territory the autonomous municipality lies on the migration route from north and sub saharan africa towards europe it is also used by syrian migrants the delegation was informed that the number of foreign nationals trying to cross melilla border irregularly has increased drastically over the last year and half the guardia civil is responsible for patrolling the land border and the coast to prevent clandestine entry the delegation was informed in melilla that the guardia civil has co operation with the moroccan gendarmerie but no formal co operation with the moroccan auxiliary forces maf which have the prime responsibility for border surveillance the spanish authorities have built multi fence barrier along the km land border separating melilla from morocco to prevent irregular migrants from accessing spanish territory the cpt notes that it was built within spanish territory and is therefore_ on both sides_ under the full jurisdiction of spain the barrier consists of six meter high fence_ slightly tilted towards morocco_ three dimensional tow line followed by second three meter high fence and_ on the other side of patrol road_ another six meter high fence at regular intervals_ gates have been inserted into the fences to enable access through the barrier from both sides in addition_ sophisticated cctv system including infrared cameras combined with movement sensors has been installed most of the fences are also equipped with anti climbing grids on february spain concluded bilateral agreement with the kingdom of morocco on the movement of persons_ transit and readmission of foreign nationals who entered illegally the readmission agreement according to the readmission agreement_ following the formal request of the border authorities of the requesting state_ border authorities of the requested state shall readmit in its territory the third country nationals who have illegally entered the territory of the requesting state from the requested state the application for readmission shall be submitted within ten days after the illegal entry into the territory of the requesting state groups of foreign nationals of varying sizes from few persons to thousand attempt_ on regular basis_ to access spanish territory regarding the attempts to access spanish territory by sea_ the cpt was informed about an incident that took place on february which was widely reported in the media members of the guardia civil fired rubber bullets from the beach at persons who were attempting to swim from moroccan territory to melilla and forced them to head back to morocco however_ not all the persons were able to swim back and it was reported that foreign nationals drowned as regards attempts to access spanish territory by climbing the border fences_ the delegation received consistent allegations_ confirmed by video footage_ that irregular migrants were stopped within or right after the border by members of the guardia civil_ occasionally handcuffed_ before being immediately forcibly returned to morocco without being identified several foreign nationals also stated to the delegation that they had been returned to morocco after being apprehended by the guardia civil several hundred meters from the border it seems that the duty of the guardia civil was seen as encompassing apprehending irregular migrants on their way to the ceti in melilla and forcibly returning them to morocco further_ foreign nationals were allegedly sometimes returned to morocco despite the fact that they were injured and could hardly walk see also paragraph the cpt considers that such practices of immediately and forcibly returning irregular migrants_ without any prior identification or screening of their needs_ would be clearly contrary to the principles and standards mentioned above the cpt recommends that clear instructions be given to spanish law enforcement officials to ensure that irregular migrants who have entered spanish territory will not be forcibly returned to morocco prior to an individualised screening with view to identifying persons in need of protection_ assessing those needs and taking appropriate action adequate guarantees in this respect be provided in national legislation the annual activity report by nils muižnieks_ commissioner for human rights of the council of europe the commissioner for human rights dated march the parts of the report of relevance to the present case read as follows visitsvisit to spainthe commissioner visited melilla and madrid from to

the ombudsperson_ ms soledad becerril bustamante_ unhcr representative in spain and civil society representatives additionally_ the commissioner held_ on january an exchange of views with members of the spanish delegation to the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe on issues raised during the visit the main issue of the visit was the draft amendment to the aliens act aimed at establishing special regime for ceuta and melilla and allowing the immediate return of migrants who did not enter ceuta and melilla through regular border post while recognising that spain has the right to establish its own immigration and border management policies_ the commissioner stressed that it must also uphold its human rights obligations therefore_ he urged the spanish authorities to ensure that any future legislation fully comply with these obligations_ which include ensuring full access to an effective asylum procedure_ providing protection against refoulement and refraining from collective expulsions he also underscored spain obligation to ensure that no push backs of migrants occur in practice and to effectively investigate all allegations of excessive use of force against migrants by law enforcement officials at the border the commissioner welcomed the opening of an asylum office at one of melilla border check points and the effective co operation of the police with unhcr at the same time_ he highlighted the need to strengthen the asylum system in melilla so as to allow all persons in need of protection_ irrespective of their country of origin_ to access the territory safely_ to have their situation assessed on an individual basis and to submit international protection claims additionally_ he urged the authorities to take urgent steps to improve existing arrangements for the reception of migrants in melilla and clarify rules governing transfers to the mainland the press release issued at the end of the visit january is available on the commissioner website the visit also served as basis for the written comments the commissioner submitted to the court as third party in november on two cases against spain and applications no and no these cases related to alleged pushbacks of migrants from the spanish city of melilla to morocco see below_ european court of human rights thematic activities human rights of immigrants_ refugees and asylum seekershuman rights of immigrants_ refugees and asylum seekers featured prominently in the commissioner work in he took an active part in various debates on these issues_ reminding council of europe member states of their human rights obligations towards immigrants_ asylum seekers and refugees issues pertaining to migration were addressed in the commissioner ad hoc visits to spain_ as well as through third party interventions before the court european court of human rightsin the commissioner made extensive use of his right to submit written comments in cases before the european court of human rights_ pursuant to article paragraph of the echr he did so in two cases against spain_ relating to alleged push backs of migrants from the spanish city of melilla to morocco on november the commissioner published the written comments he submitted to the court on two cases against spain and applications no and no relating to alleged pushbacks of migrants from the spanish city of melilla to morocco based inter alia on his visit to melilla and madrid from to january the commissioner points to the existence of practice whereby migrants who attempt to enter melilla in groups by climbing the fence surrounding the city are summarily returned by spain border guards to morocco the commissioner underlines that these returns take place outside of any formal procedure and without identification of the persons concerned or assessment of their individual situation_ circumstance which prevents them from effectively exercising their right to seek international protection in spain additionally_ he stresses that migrants summarily returned from melilla have no access to an effective remedy which would enable them to challenge their removal or seek redress for any ill treatment they may have been subjected to during such operations report dated september of the fact finding mission by ambassador tomáš boček_ special representative of the secretary general on migration and refugees_ to spain_ march sg inf the relevant parts of this report read as follows the situation in melilla and ceuta preventing access to the territoryasylum seekers and migrants in an irregular situation enter into the autonomous cities of melilla and ceuta both through the land and sea borders as regards land borders_ melilla is surrounded by km triple fence the external and internal fences are six metres high and the middle one is lower three dimensional barrier which is structure of steel cables tied to stakes the fence is equipped with sensors to detect movements towards its external part when such movements are detected the guardia civil notifies the moroccan authorities_ which in turn often prevent people in the moroccan territory from jumping the fence on previous occasions_ have drawn attention to practices involving information sharing by the border police with the relevant authorities of neighbouring country regarding suspected unauthorised border crossings and the subsequent action of the authorities in the neighbouring country to intercept migrants and refugees before they cross the border have underlined the questions that these practices raise with regard to the right to seek asylum and the respect for the principle of non refoulement it is legitimate that council of europe member states_ in the exercise of their right to prevent unauthorised border crossings as well as to prevent and combat cross border criminal activities co operate with neighbouring countries including through the sharing of relevant information however_ as matter of principle_ member states should exercise human rights due diligence in the context of such co operation they should take into account the situation in their neighbouring countries and refrain from sharing information with or requesting the latter to intercept people before they reach member states borders when they know_ or should have known_ that the intercepted persons would as result be exposed to real risk of torture or inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment and that they would not be given protection in the neighbouring countries summary to the spanish law no on the rights and freedoms of aliens in spain and their social integration the law on aliens foreigners who attempt to cross the border irregularly_ including persons intercepted at and near the border_ may be denied entry or may be rejected at the border in order to prevent their illegal entry into spain in accordance with the law on aliens_ their return shall in all cases be carried out in compliance with the international human rights standards applications for international protection shall be submitted in dedicated placed provided for that purpose at the border crossings the guardia civil explained to us that attempts by foreigners to jump the fences happened on daily basis_ although not by massive groups of people as it had been frequently the case in and when foreigners attempt to jump the fences in both melilla and ceuta the guardia civil does not intervene unless they have climbed down the internal fences in most of the cases foreigners endure physical injuries while jumping over the fences this is the reason why the authorities have entered into co operation protocol with the spanish red cross_ which provides immediate medical assistance to intercepted foreigners the guardia civil explained to us that foreigners who jump the fences are usually violent and that they do not communicate with authorities but rather attempt to escape from them the guardia civil also does not seek to establish any communication with foreigners hence_ no claims for international protection are expressed by foreigners either while climbing or when intercepted at or near the border after jumping the fences shortly after receiving the spanish red cross assistance they are returned to morocco through special doors_ which are spread throughout the border fences and are distinct from border crossing points foreigners do not have access to interpreters_ lawyers or the asylum offices located at border crossing point finally_ they are returned to morocco without any identification or registration having taken place in chamber judgment_ the european court of human rights found that the immediate return to morocco of sub saharan migrants who were attempting to enter into melilla amounted to collective expulsion and held that there had been violation of article protocol and article of the echr taken together with article protocol the case has been referred to the grand chamber articles and of the echr entail an obligation on the part of council of europe member states not to return person to his her country of origin_ any other country to which removal is to be effected or any other country to which he she may subsequently be removed_ where there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would run real risk to his her life or real risk of being subjected to torture and other forms of ill treatment on the basis of the principle of non refoulement enshrined in article of the geneva convention on the status of refugees and the relevant jurisprudence of the european court of human rights_ states are obliged to screen intercepted migrants with view to identifying persons in need of protection_ assessing those needs and enabling the relevant persons access to asylum procedures while the spanish law on aliens contains general guarantee that the returns described above will be carried out in compliance with international human rights standards_ in practice the guardia civil does not yet have protocol on screening foreigners who irregularly cross the borders in melilla and ceuta which would provide instructions to its officers on identifying persons in need of international protection and taking necessary action regarding their access to fair and efficient asylum procedure as international bodies_ including the commissioner for human rights_ the cpt and the unhcr_ have called for the issuance of such instructions for some years it is now necessary that spain takes action the council of europe can provide its human rights expertise to ensure that the relevant instructions provide for the respect of the principle of non refoulement_ prohibit collective expulsion and contain the necessary procedural guarantees regarding access to fair and effective asylum procedure access to the asylum procedureanyone who wishes to seek international protection in spain must lodge formal application with the competent authorities in cases when the asylum seeker is at an airport_ maritime port or land borders he she must lodge formal application with the border control authority if the person is already on spanish territory he she must lodge formal application with the oar_ in detention centres for foreigners centro de internamiento de extranjeros_ cies or police stations the admissibility and merits of applications lodged at the borders and in cies are assessed within shorter periods of time compared to applications lodged in spanish territory_ which are examined under the regular procedure however_ procedural safeguards for applications lodged at the border or in cies concerning the presence of interpreters and legal assistance are the same as those applicable under the regular procedure at the land borderat the beni enzar border crossing point in melilla we were informed that the persons who crossed the border in regular manner in order to seek asylum are mostly syrians_ palestinians_ algerians or nationals of other northern african countries they are given an appointment for preliminary interview by ministry of interior officials within two or three days_ but no later than nine days_ from the time they express their intention to seek asylum the registration of asylum applications and preliminary interview takes place in dedicated premises adjacent to beni enzar at the time of our visit there had been around asylum requests for the oar in madrid usually makes decision on the admissibility of the applications within hours of the registration of the application the admissibility rate is rather high at after decision on admissibility the merits of the asylum application is examined with priority within three months under the regular asylum procedure see section below at the el trajal border crossing point in ceuta we were informed by the spanish authorities that no single asylum application had been lodged since number of reports have underlined that persons from sub saharan africa are effectively prevented by moroccan authorities from approaching regular border crossing points_ notably in melilla see section above consequently_ they do not have access to the asylum procedure spanish authorities explained that one of the possible reasons why sub saharan africans cannot approach the border are the sizeable daily flows of persons involved in the so called atypical trade who cross the border daily into and out of melilla while understand the difficulties that the spanish authorities encounter in managing such flows was not convinced that they affect the ability of sub saharan africans to approach the spanish border without any possibility for legal and safe access to the spanish territory_ persons from sub saharan africa_ including women and young children_ turn to organised crime networks_ hiding in cars or embarking on rafts to gain access to the autonomous cities of melilla and ceuta_ thereby exposing themselves to risks of trafficking in human beings_ violence and sexual abuse it is_ therefore_ important that the spanish authorities provide to persons in need of international protection the possibility to access the spanish territory safely so that they can submit their asylum claims resolution of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe_ adopted on june pushback policies and practice in council of europe member states the relevant parts of this report read as follows to control and manage migration flows_ council of europe member states concentrate much of their efforts on guarding frontiers in this context_ refusals of entry and expulsions without any individual assessment of protection needs have become documented phenomenon at europe borders_ as well as on the territory of member states further inland as these practices are widespread_ and in some countries systematic_ these pushbacks can be considered as part of national policies rather than incidental actions the highest risk attached to pushbacks is the risk of refoulement_ meaning that person is sent back to place where they might face persecution in the sense of the united nations convention relating to the status of refugees the refugee convention or inhuman or degrading treatment in the sense of the european convention on human rights ets no the convention this is why the european court of human rights_ for instance in its judgment hirsi jamaa and others italy application no but also in and spain applications nos and requires the individual assessment of protection needs and of the safety of return in order to prevent violation of article of the european convention on human rights and of the prohibition of collective expulsions_ as enshrined in article of protocol no to the convention ets no pushbacks take place in particular at european union borders_ which is at least in part consequence of the shortcomings of the current dublin regulation and of the failure of attempts to introduce fair responsibility sharing in europe pushbacks often take place where migrants attempt to enter the territory of member state in large numbers because the passage is_ or appears to be_ more open than elsewhere_ or is geographically close to the countries of origin of asylum seekers however_ recent evidence of pushbacks shows that they also take place where numbers of arrivals are low_ but where national policies are hostile towards migration in general there are also cases of multiple pushbacks where migrants are expelled by various countries successively the parliamentary assembly is concerned about the persistent and increasing practice and policies of pushbacks_ which are in clear violation of the rights of asylum seekers and refugees_ including the right to asylum and the right to protection against refoulement_ which are at the core of international refugee and human rights law in view of the gravity of the human rights violations involved_ the assembly urges member states to provide adequate protection to asylum seekers_ refugees and migrants arriving at their borders_ and thus to refrain from any pushbacks_ to allow for independent monitoring and to fully investigate all allegations of pushbacks the assembly is extremely worried about persistent reports and evidence of inhuman and degrading treatment of migrants by member states and their agencies in the framework of these pushbacks_ through intimidation_ confiscating or destroying migrants belongings_ and even through the use of violence and by depriving migrants of food and basic services in denying having carried out such pushbacks_ these types of sometimes systematic inhuman and degrading treatment are denied as well_ and are therefore not adequately examined or not examined at all the assembly therefore calls on council of europe member states to comply with their international obligations in this regard_ in particular those set out in the european convention on human rights concerning the prohibition of collective expulsion and inhuman and degrading treatment_ as well as the right of access to asylum procedures and the prohibition of refoulement as established in the united nations refugee convention iv other

universal declaration of human rights shall be respected by all other states article no person referred to in article paragraph shall be subjected to measures such as rejection at the frontier or_ if he has already entered the territory in which he seeks asylum_ expulsion or compulsory return to any state where he may be subjected to persecution international law commission draft articles on the expulsion of aliens at its sixty sixth session_ in the international law commission adopted set of draft articles on the expulsion of aliens the text_ of which the united nations general assembly took note resolution res of december includes the following provisions article scope the present draft articles apply to the expulsion by state of aliens present in its territory commentary in stating that the draft articles apply to the expulsion by state of aliens who are present in its territory_ paragraph defines the scope of the draft articles both ratione materiae and ratione personae with regard to scope ratione materiae_ which relates to the measures covered by the draft articles_ reference is made simply to the expulsion by state which covers any and all expulsion measures no further elaboration is provided_ since expulsion is defined in draft article subparagraph below with regard to scope ratione personae_ that is_ the persons covered by the draft articles_ it follows from paragraph that the draft articles apply in general to the expulsion of all aliens present in the territory of the expelling state_ with no distinction between the various categories of persons involved_ for example_ aliens lawfully present in the territory of the expelling state_ aliens unlawfully present_ displaced persons_ asylum seekers_ persons granted asylum and stateless persons the term alien is defined in draft article subparagraph the draft articles cover the expulsion of both aliens lawfully present and those unlawfully present in the territory of the expelling state_ as paragraph of the draft article indicates the category of aliens unlawfully present in the territory of the expelling state covers both aliens who have entered the territory unlawfully and aliens whose presence in the territory has subsequently become unlawful_ primarily because of violation of the laws of the expelling state governing conditions of stay although the draft articles apply in general to the expulsion of aliens present lawfully or unlawfully in the territory of the expelling state_ it should be noted at the outset that some provisions of the draft articles draw necessary distinctions between the two categories of aliens_ particularly with respect to the rights to which they are entitled it should be also noted that the inclusion within the scope of the draft articles of aliens whose presence in the territory of the expelling state is unlawful is to be understood in conjunction with the phrase in article subparagraph in fine_ which excludes from the scope of the draft articles questions concerning non admission of an alien to the territory of state article use of terms for the purposes of the present draft articles expulsion means formal act or conduct attributable to state by which an alien is compelled to leave the territory of that state it does not include extradition to another state_ surrender to an international criminal court or tribunal_ or the non admission of an alien to state alien means an individual who does not have the nationality of the state in whose territory that individual is present commentary draft article defines two key terms_ expulsion and alien for the purposes of the present draft articles conduct other than the adoption of formal decision that could result in expulsion may take the form of either an action or an omission on the part of the state omission might in particular consist of tolerance towards conduct directed against the alien by individuals or private entities_ for example_ if the state failed to appropriately protect an alien from hostile acts emanating from non state actors what appears to be the determining element in the definition of expulsion is that_ as result of either formal act or conduct active or passive attributable to the state_ the alien in question is compelled to leave the territory of that state in addition_ in order to conclude that there has been expulsion as result of conduct that is_ without the adoption of formal decision it is essential to establish the intention of the state in question_ by means of that conduct_ to bring about the departure of the alien from its territory for the sake of clarity_ the commission thought it useful to specify_ in the second clause of subparagraph that the concept of expulsion within the meaning of the draft articles did not cover extradition of an alien to another state_ surrender to an international criminal court or tribunal or the non admission of an alien to state with respect to non admission_ it should be explained that_ in some legal regimes_ the term return refoulement is sometimes used instead of non admission for the sake of consistency_ the present draft articles use the latter term in cases where an alien is refused entry the exclusion relates to the refusal by the authorities of state usually the authorities responsible for immigration and border control to allow an alien to enter the territory of that state on the other hand_ the measures taken by state to compel an alien already present in its territory_ even if unlawfully present_ to leave it are covered by the concept of expulsion as defined in draft article subparagraph this distinction should be understood in the light of the definition of the scope ratione personae of the draft articles_ which includes both aliens lawfully present in the territory of the expelling state and those unlawfully present moreover the exclusion of matters relating to non admission from the scope of the draft articles is without prejudice to the rules of international law relating to refugees that reservation is explained by draft article subparagraph which references the prohibition against return refoulement within the meaning of article of the convention on the status of refugees of july and hence inevitably touches on questions of admission article right of expulsion state has the right to expel an alien from its territory expulsion shall be in accordance with the present draft articles_ without prejudice to other applicable rules of international law_ in particular those relating to human rights article prohibition of the expulsion of refugees the present draft articles are without prejudice to the rules of international law relating to refugees_ as well as to any more favourable rules or practice on refugee protection_ and in particular to the following rules state shall not expel refugee lawfully in its territory save on grounds of national security or public order state shall not expel or return refouler refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where the person life or freedom would be threatened on account of his or her race_ religion_ nationality_ membership of particular social group or political opinion_ unless there are reasonable grounds for regarding the person as danger to the security of the country in which he or she is_ or if the person_ having been convicted by final judgement of particularly serious crime_ constitutes danger to the community of that country commentary draft article deals with the expulsion of refugees_ which is subject to restrictive conditions by virtue of the relevant rules of international law it contains without prejudice clause aimed at ensuring the continued application to refugees of the rules concerning their expulsion_ as well as of any more favourable rules or practice on refugee protection in particular_ subparagraphs and of draft article recall two particularly important rules concerning the expulsion or return refoulement of refugees draft article subparagraph reproduces the wording of article paragraph of the convention relating to the status of refugees of july the rule contained in that paragraph_ which applies only to refugees lawfully in the territory of the expelling state_ limits the grounds for expulsion of such refugees to those relating to reasons of national security or public order the prohibition of expulsion of refugee lawfully in the territory of the expelling state for any grounds other than national security or public order has also been extended to any refugee who_ being unlawfully in the territory of the state_ has applied for refugee status_ as long as this application is under consideration however_ such protection can be envisaged only for so long as the application is pending this protection_ which reflects trend in the legal literature and finds support in the practice of some states and of unhcr_ would constitute departure from the principle whereby the unlawfulness of the presence of an alien in the territory of state can in itself justify expulsion of the alien the protection might be set aside only in cases where the manifest intent of the application for refugee status was to thwart an expulsion decision likely to be handed down against the individual concerned it concerns only individuals who_ while not enjoying the status of refugee in the state in question_ did meet the definition of refugee within the meaning of the convention or_ in some cases_ other relevant instruments_ such as the oau convention governing the specific aspects of refugee problems in africa_ and should therefore be regarded as refugees under international law any individual who does not correspond to the definition of refugee within the meaning of the relevant legal instruments is ineligible to enjoy the protection recognized in draft article and can be expelled on grounds other than those stipulated in subparagraph including on the sole ground of the unlawfulness of his or her presence in the territory of the expelling state in any event_ article is without prejudice to the right of state to expel_ for reasons other than those mentioned in subparagraph an alien whose application for refugee status is manifestly abusive draft article subparagraph which concerns the obligation of non refoulement_ combines paragraphs and of article of the convention unlike the other provisions of the draft articles_ which do not cover the situation of non admission of an alien to the territory of state_ draft article subparagraph provides that these draft articles are without prejudice to that situation as well_ as indicated by the opening phrase state shall not expel or return refouler moreover_ unlike the protection stipulated in subparagraph the protection mentioned in subparagraph applies to all refugees_ regardless of whether their presence in the receiving state is lawful or unlawful it should also be emphasized that the mention of this specific obligation of non refoulement of refugees is without prejudice to the application to them of the general rules prohibiting expulsion to certain states as contained in draft articles and article prohibition of collective expulsion for the purposes of the present draft article_ collective expulsion means expulsion of aliens_ as group the collective expulsion of aliens is prohibited state may expel concomitantly the members of group of aliens_ provided that the expulsion takes place after and on the basis of an assessment of the particular case of each individual member of the group in accordance with the present draft articles the present draft article is without prejudice to the rules of international law applicable to the expulsion of aliens in the event of an armed conflict involving the expelling state commentary paragraph of draft article contains definition of collective expulsion for the purposes of the present draft articles according to this definition_ collective expulsion is understood to mean the expulsion of aliens as group this criterion is informed by the case law of the european court of human rights it is criterion that the special rapporteur on the rights of non citizens of the commission on human rights_ mr david weissbrodt_ had also endorsed in his final report of only the collective aspect is addressed in this definition_ which must be understood in the light of the general definition of expulsion contained in draft article subparagraph the prohibition of the collective expulsion of aliens set out in paragraph of the present draft article should be read in the light of paragraph which elucidates it by specifying the conditions under which the members of group of aliens may be expelled concomitantly without such measure being regarded as collective expulsion within the meaning of the draft articles paragraph states that such an expulsion is permissible provided that it takes place after and on the basis of an assessment of the particular case of each individual member of the group in accordance with the present draft articles article obligation to respect the human dignity and human rights of aliens subject to expulsion all aliens subject to expulsion shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person at all stages of the expulsion process they are entitled to respect for their human rights_ including those set out in the present draft articles article prohibition of torture or cruel_ inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment the expelling state shall not subject an alien subject to expulsion to torture or to cruel_ inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in his second report on the expulsion of aliens_ dated july document cn examined in connection with the writing of the draft articles_ mr maurice kamto_ special rapporteur_ stated as follows the traditional notion of expulsion concerns aliens whose entry or stay are lawful_ whereas non admission concerns those whose entry into or stay on its territory state seeks to prevent removal of an illegal immigrant who is at the border or has just crossed it is strictly speaking non admission_ not expulsion it is by virtue of this judicious distinction that non admission does not_ in the opinion of the special rapporteur_ fall within the scope of this topic as can be seen_ no real terminological distinction can be drawn among the three terms expulsion escort to the border and refoulement they are used inter changeably_ without any particular semantic rigour the word expulsion will consequently be used in the context of the present topic as generic term to mean all situa tions covered by all three terms and many others_ such as return of an alien to country or exclusion of an alien this list not being exhaustive conclusions on international protection adopted by the executive committee of the unhcr programme the relevant conclusions provide as follows no xxviii non refoulement th session of the executive committee the executive committee_ reaffirms the fundamental importance of the observance of the principle of non refoulement both at the border and within the territory of state of persons who may be subjected to persecution if returned to their country of origin irrespective of whether or not they have been formally recognized as refugees no xxxii protection of asylum seekers in situations of large scale influx nd session of the executive committee ii measures of protectiona admission and non refoulement in situations of large scale influx_ asylum seekers should be admitted to the state in which they first seek refuge and if that state is unable to admit them on durable basis_ it should always admit them at least on temporary basis and provide them with protection according to the principles set out below in all cases the fundamental principle of non refoulement including non rejection at the frontier must be scrupulously observed no xlviii safeguarding asylum th session of the executive committee the executive committee_ reiterates the need for full respect to be accorded to the institution of asylum in general_ and considers it timely to draw attention to the following particular aspects the principle of non refoulement_ which prohibits expulsion and return of refugees in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where their lives or freedom would be threatened on account of their race_ religion_ nationality_ membership of particular social group or political opinion_ whether or not they have been formally granted refugee status_ or of persons in respect of whom there are substantial grounds for believing that they would be in danger of being subjected to torture_ as set forth in the convention against torture and other cruel_ inhuman_ or degrading treatment or punishment iii the need to admit refugees into the territories of states_ which includes no rejection at frontiers without fair and effective procedures for determining status and protection needs no lv general conclusion th session of the executive committee the executive committee_ expresses concern at the persecution_ generalized violence and violations of human rights which continue to cause and perpetuate displacement within and beyond national borders and which increase the challenges faced by states in effecting durable solutions and calls on states to address these challenges while ensuring full respect for the fundamental principle of non refoulement_ including non rejection at frontiers without access to fair and effective procedures for determining status and protection needs views adopted by the committee on the rights of the child on february under the optional protocol to the convention on the rights of the child on communications procedure_ concerning communication no the relevant parts of these views read as follows the facts as submitted by the complainant on december the author and group of people of sub saharan origin left mount gurugu with the intention of entering melilla the author reached the top of the third fence and saw that other people climbing down the fence on the other side were being summarily pushed back by the spanish civil guard and handed over to moroccan forces then_ for fear of being deported and subjected to possible ill treatment and violence by moroccan forces_ the author waited for several hours at the top of the fence during this period_ he was not offered any form of assistance he had no access to water or food he was also unable to communicate with the civil guard_ since he did not speak spanish and there were no interpreters present finally_ he climbed down the fence with the help of ladder provided by the civil guard as soon as he set foot on the ground_ he was arrested and handcuffed by the civil guard_ handed over to the moroccan forces and summarily deported to morocco at no time was his identity checked he was also denied the opportunity to explain his personal circumstances_ give his age_ challenge his imminent deportation or claim protection as an unaccompanied child he was not assisted by lawyers_ interpreters or doctors the author submits that there were no effective domestic remedies available to him that could have served to suspend his deportation from spain to morocco on december he points out that the deportation was summarily executed without him being notified of formal expulsion decision that he could have challenged before the competent authorities on or around about december the author entered spain through melilla and went to stay in the temporary reception centre for migrants in february he was transferred from the enclave of melilla to mainland spain at the end of july thanks to the assistance of fundación raíces_ non governmental organization ngo and the consular registration card issued to him by the malian consulate in madrid_ which showed his date of birth as march the author obtained protection as an unaccompanied child and was placed in residential centre for minors under the care of the spanish authorities the author states that_ on march spain adopted organic act no on safeguarding the security of citizens_ which entered into force on april this law_ and in particular its tenth additional provision concerning the special regime applicable in ceuta and melilla_ legalizes the spanish practice of indiscriminate summary deportations at the border and makes no reference to unaccompanied minors nor establishes any procedure for their identification and protection issues and proceedings before the of admissibility as to the mismatches between the details of the person registered by the spanish authorities and those of the author_ the committee notes that the file provides no conclusive evidence that shows that the author is not the person who attempted to gain access to melilla on december in the circumstances described the committee considers that the burden of proof cannot rest solely on the author of the communication_ especially given that the author and the state party do not always have equal access to the evidence and that frequently the state party alone has access to the relevant information in the present case_ the committee considers that the author has provided credible and consistent account of the facts_ which is supported by evidence the committee also notes the author allegations that the state party could have compared the fingerprints of the person registered as with those of the author the committee therefore finds the present communication admissible rationae personae the committee takes note of the state party argument that the communication is inadmissible rationae loci because the actions of the moroccan authorities are not attributable to spain the committee notes_ however_ that the scope of the present communication is limited to the actions of the spanish authorities on december to the exclusion of those of the moroccan authorities in this regard_ the committee notes that_ according to the author_ he was arrested by spanish security forces at the third fence of the melilla border crossing and was handcuffed and returned to moroccan territory given these circumstances_ and irrespective of whether or not the author is considered to have arrived in spanish territory_ he was under the authority or effective control of the state party the committee therefore finds the present communication admissible rationae loci the committee also notes the state party argument that the communication is inadmissible rationae materiae because it refers to the author right to asylum_ which is not covered by the convention the committee notes_ however_ that the present communication concerns alleged violations of the author rights under articles and of the convention and not his right to asylum the committee therefore finds that the communication is admissible rationae materiae lastly_ the committee notes the state party argument that the complainant did not exhaust available domestic remedies the committee also notes that it can be gleaned from the case file that on december no formal expulsion order against the author had been issued accordingly_ the committee considers that_ in the context of the author imminent expulsion on december and in the absence of formal expulsion order that could have been challenged by the author_ the judicial remedies mentioned in point of the state party argument would have been worthless_ as they were neither available nor effective the committee therefore finds the complaint admissible and proceeds to consider it on the merits consideration of the merits the issue before the committee is whether_ in the circumstances of this case_ the author return to morocco by the spanish civil guard on december violated his rights under the convention in particular_ the author claimed that_ by summarily deporting him to morocco on december without performing any form of identity check or assessment of his situation_ the state party failed to provide the author with the special protection and assistance to which he was entitled as an unaccompanied minor art failed to respect the principle of non refoulement and exposed the author to the risk of violence and cruel_ inhuman and degrading treatment in morocco art and failed to consider the best interests of the child art the committee is of the view that the state obligations to provide special protection and assistance to unaccompanied children_ in accordance with article of the convention_ apply even with respect to those children who come under the state jurisdiction when attempting to enter the country territory similarly_ the committee considers that the positive aspect of these protection obligations also extends to requiring states to take all necessary measures to identify children as being unaccompanied or separated at the earliest possible stage_ including at the border accordingly_ it is imperative and necessary that_ in order to comply with its obligations under article of the convention and to respect the best interests of the child_ the state conducts an initial assessment_ prior to any removal or return_ that includes the following stages assessment_ as matter of priority_ of whether the person concerned is an unaccompanied minor_ with_ in the event of uncertainty_ the individual being accorded the benefit of the doubt such that_ if there is possibility that the individual is child_ he or she is treated as such verification of the child identity by means of an initial interview and assessment of the child specific situation and particular if any the committee is also of the view that_ in compliance with its obligations under article of the convention_ in order to ensure that no child is subjected to torture or other cruel_ inhuman or degrading treatment_ the state should not return child to country where there are substantial grounds for believing that there is real risk of irreparable harm to the child the committee therefore considers that_ in accordance with article of the convention and the principle of non refoulement_ the state has an obligation to carry out prior assessment of the risk_ if any_ of irreparable harm to the child and serious violations of his or her rights in the country to which he or she will be transferred or returned_ taking into account the best interests of the child_ including_ for example_ the particularly serious consequences for children of the insufficient provision of food or health services in particular_ the committee recalls that_ in the context of best interest assessments and within best interest determination procedures_ children should be guaranteed the right to access the territory_ regardless of the documentation they have or lack_ and be referred to the authorities in charge of evaluating their needs in terms of protection of their rights_ ensuring their procedural safeguards the committee also notes the state party allegation that the principle of non refoulement does not apply in the present case because it only applies when the person comes from territory where there is risk of persecution however_ the committee reiterates that the state party has an obligation not to return child to country where there are substantial grounds for believing that there is real risk of irreparable harm to the child the committee also notes that_ before returning the author to morocco_ the state party did not ascertain his identity_ did not ask about his personal circumstances and did not conduct prior assessment of the risk_ if any_ of persecution and or irreparable harm in the country to which he was to be returned the committee considers that_ given the violence faced by migrants in the moroccan border area and the ill treatment to which the author was subjected_ the failure to assess the risk of irreparable harm to the author prior to his deportation or to take into account his best interests constitutes violation of articles and of the convention the committee considers that_ in the light of the circumstances of the case_ the fact that the author_ as an unaccompanied child_ did not undergo an identity check and assessment of his situation prior to his deportation and was not given an opportunity to challenge his potential deportation violates his rights under articles and of the convention lastly_ the committee considers that the manner in which the author was deported_ as an unaccompanied child deprived of his family environment and in context of international migration_ after having been detained and handcuffed and without having been heard_ without receiving the assistance of lawyer or interpreter and without regard to his needs_ constitutes treatment prohibited under article of the convention the committee_ acting under article of the optional protocol_ is of the view that the facts before it amount to violation of articles and of the convention

the same press release quoted declaration by the commander of the rog_ general boris sergeyev_ to the effect that the latest withdrawals had been made possible by an agreement with the under which the mrt was to receive half of the non military equipment and supplies withdrawn general sergeyev cited the example of the withdrawal_ on december of lorries_ which had been followed by the transfer of russian military lorries to the according to the evidence heard by the court in the ilaşcu case_ in at least tonnes of russian arms and ammunition remained in transdniestria_ mainly at colbaşna_ together with battle tanks_ armoured cars_ armoured personnel carriers_ armoured reconnaissance vehicles_ cannons and mortars_ anti tank weapons_ anti aircraft guns_ nine helicopters and vehicles of various kinds see the ilaşcu judgment_ cited above_ in the osce observed and verified the withdrawal from transdniestria of trains of russian military equipment and trains loaded with more than tons of ammunition however_ the following year_ in the osce reported that only one train containing approximately tons of ammunition had been removed since there have been no verified withdrawals of any russian arms or equipment from transdniestria the court found in ilaşcu that_ at the end of approximately metric tons of ammunition remained_ together with more than small arms and light weapons and approximately ten trainloads of miscellaneous military equipment in november delegation from the osce were allowed access to the ammunition stores and reported that over tons of ammunition remained stored there see paragraph below the commander of the rog reported in may that surplus stocks of small arms and light weapons had been destroyed_ but no independent observer was allowed access in order to verify these claims in their observations in the present case_ the russian government submitted that most of the weapons_ ammunition and military property were removed between and and that all that remained in the warehouses were shells_ hand grenades_ mortar bombs and small arms ammunition the parties to the present case agreed that approximately russian servicemen were stationed in transdniestria to guard the arms store in addition_ the parties agreed that there were approximately russian soldiers stationed in the security area as part of the internationally agreed peace keeping force the security area was km long and km wide alleged russian economic and political support for the mrt again_ it should be noted that the russian government contended that events in transdniestria prior to the schools crisis were not relevant to the issues in the present case in the ilaşcu judgment the court found it uncontested that the arms industry_ which was one of the pillars of the transdniestrian economy_ was directly supported by russian firms including the rosvoorouzhenie росвооружение and elektrommash companies the russian firm iterra had bought the largest undertaking in transdniestria_ the râbniţa engineering works_ despite the opposition of the moldovan authorities in addition_ the russian army constituted major employer and purchaser of supplies in transdniestria according to the applicants in the present case_ russia accounted for of the mrt exports and of its imports_ primarily energy the mrt paid for less than of the gas it had consumed for example_ in transdniestria consumed usd million worth of gas_ but paid for only usd million the russian government explained that since the mrt was not recognised as separate entity under international law_ it could not have its own sovereign debts and russia did not effect separate gas supplies for moldova and transdniestria the bill for supplying gas to transdniestria was_ therefore_ attributed to moldova the supply of gas to the region was organised through the russian public corporation gazprom and the joint stock company moldovagaz_ which was owned jointly by moldova and the mrt the debt owed by moldovagaz to russia exceeded usd billion_ of which usd billion related to gas consumed in transdniestria gazprom could not simply refuse to supply gas to the region_ since it needed pipelines through moldova to supply the balkan states the applicants further alleged that russia provided direct humanitarian aid to transdniestria_ mostly in the form of contributions to old age pensions the applicants claimed that official russian sources stated that between and the total volume of financial assistance to transdniestria was usd million the moldovan government submitted that in the mrt received financial aid from russia totalling usd million the russian government submitted that the amount of aid given to russian citizens living in the region for humanitarian purposes_ such as the payment of pensions and assistance with catering in schools_ prisons and hospitals_ was fully transparent_ and could be compared with humanitarian aid provided by the european union as well as providing aid to the population living in transdniestria_ russia provided aid to those living in other parts of moldova in addition_ the applicants claimed that some individuals living in transdniestria had been granted russian citizenship these included many of the mrt leaders the court considers that this should be put in the context of the findings of census carried out in by the mrt government which found_ in the area under their control_ population of people_ approximately of whom came from the moldovan community_ of whom were russian and were ukrainian_ with small percentages of other national and ethnic groups the schools crisis and the facts concerning the applicants cases according to article of the mrt constitution the official languages within the mrt are moldavian russian and ukrainian article of the mrt law on languages which was adopted on september states that_ for all purposes_ moldavian must be written with the cyrillic alphabet the law provides further that use of the latin alphabet may amount to an offence and article of the mrt code of administrative offences adopted on july states that failure by persons holding public office and other persons in the executive and state administration_ in public associations_ as well as in other organisations_ regardless of their legal status and form of ownership_ and in other entities_ situated on the territory of the mrt_ to observe mrt legislation on the functioning of languages on the territory of mrt entails liability in the form of fine which may amount to fifty minimal salaries on august the mrt authorities forbade the use of the latin script in schools by decision of may the mrt ordered that all schools belonging to foreign states and functioning on its territory had to register with

assembly of the council of europe on september the committee on the honouring of obligations and commitments by member states of the council of europe monitoring committee of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe pace issued report on the functioning of the democratic institutions in moldova the section devoted to transdniestria reads as follows major new developments have occurred during the last months which the assembly has to follow very closely and accompany in the best possible way following intense diplomatic contacts between moldova and ukraine_ at the guam summit in chisinau on april the ukrainian president yushchenko announced point initiative to settle the transnistrian issue the main thrust of this new plan is to achieve long lasting solution through the democratisation of transnistria this would entail the creation of conditions for the development of democracy_ civil society_ and multi party system in transnistria holding of free and democratic elections to the transniestrian supreme soviet_ monitored by the european union_ the osce_ the council of europe_ russia_ united states_ and other democratic countries including ukraine the transformation of the current format of peacekeeping operation into an international mission of military and civil observers under the aegis of the osce and the expansion of the number of ukrainian military observers in the region admission by transniestrian authorities of an international monitoring mission_ to include ukrainian experts_ to military industrial enterprises in the transniestrian region short term osce monitoring mission in ukraine to verify the movement of goods and persons through the ukrainian moldovan border the full text of the ukrainian plan was presented on may at meeting of the representatives of the mediators and moldova and transnistria in vinnitsa_ ukraine after the ukrainian secretary of security council pyotr poroshenko and moldavian presidential aide mark tkachuk spent almost month doing shuttle diplomacy the reactions were varied but cautiously positive on june the moldovan parliament adopted declaration on the ukrainian initiative of settlement of the transnistrian conflict as well as two appeals_ on and on promoting the criteria of democratisation of the transnistrian region of the republic of moldova the declaration welcomed the initiative of president yushchenko_ hoping that it would become major factor in the achievement by moldova of its territorial and civil unity the parliament however regretted that the ukrainian initiative did not reflect some important principles of settlement_ in the first place the withdrawal of russian troops the principles and conditions of the region democratisation and the establishing of transparent and legal control over the transnistrian segment of the moldovan ukrainian border it called for additional efforts by the international community and ukraine in this respect the parliament also criticised number of provisions which might infringe upon the sovereignty of the republic of moldova such as the co participation of transnistria in the conduct of foreign policy of the republic of moldova and the proposal to create the so called conciliation committee the parliament insisted on resolving the conflict within the framework of the moldovan constitution through dialogue with new_ democratically elected_ transnistrian leadership there are thus number of divergences between the ukrainian initiative and the approach to implementing it chosen by moldova the mediators in the transnistrian conflict the osce_ russia and ukraine stated that the plan provided concrete impetus toward achieving settlement at all of their latest meetings they called for resuming direct_ continuing dialogue on resolution of the conflict more delicate is the position of russia it is clear that through its military and economic presence and thanks to the strong cultural and linguistic links with transnistria_ russia would like to retain its strong influence over the territory the press recently reported the existence of an action plan of retaining russian influence in the moldova republic details of which are kept secret russia is still strongly attached to the so called kozak memorandum of which proposed to moldova federal solution moldova had nearly accepted the plan it refused to sign it at the last moment_ allegedly under western influence over the last months_ there have been several signs of tension for instance_ on february the russian federation state duma adopted with large majority resolution requesting from the russian government number of economic and other sanctions against moldova_ with the exclusion of transnistria_ if the moldovan authorities did not change their economic blockade of transdniestria the sanctions included ban on imports of moldovan alcohol and tobacco_ world market prices for exports of russian natural gas to moldova and visas for moldovans entering russia both appeals adopted by the moldovan parliament called on the council of europe for support and_ concerning the democratisation of transnistria_ to engage actively in the process during our visit in chisinau our interlocutors repeatedly stressed the importance they attached to the expertise and experience of our organisation in this respect the documents adopted by the moldovan parliament were officially submitted by its speaker to the monitoring committee for examination in the framework of the moldova monitoring exercise and for analysis_ comments and as well as ideas of the parliamentary assembly that could contribute to the democratisation of the transnistrian region and final settlement of the conflict at the first sight_ the plan should be followed closely by the council of europe_ as the leading organisation in the field of democracy_ human rights and rule of law the committee has therefore entrusted us with the responsibility of visiting kiev_ moscow_ bucharest and brussels in order to meet the main figures responsible for the ukrainian plan and get acquainted with all its details on the basis of this information we will make specific proposals for the assembly to play an effective part in the plan progress number of questions remain about the implementation of the ukrainian plan and the conditions set by the moldovan parliament however_ against the background of all the failed diplomatic attempts_ it has one strong advantage it combines diplomatic efforts with specific measures for in transnistria but also in moldova_ which must serve as an example the initiative also comes at the right moment_ as it coincides with major strive for democratisation and european integration in the entire region not only moldova_ whose territorial integrity and sovereignty have been violated_ but europe as whole can no longer afford to have this black hole on its territory transnistria is centre of all kinds of illicit trade and_ in the first place arms trafficking and all forms of smuggling political life continues to be dominated by the secret police fundamental freedom and liberties are curtailed one of the most difficult elements appears to be the possibility to organise democratic elections in transnistria for this the region needs to have freely functioning political parties_ media and civil society the march local elections in transnistria to elect village_ settlement_ city and district councils_ as well as the chairmen of village and settlement councils showed that real strong opposition is still missing these elections by the way were considered as test for the scheduled december elections for the transnistrian supreme soviet however_ there are some interesting developments_ especially concerning group of supreme soviet members led by the deputy speaker evgeny shevchuk on april this group initiated ambitious draft changes to the transnistrian constitution aiming at reinforcing this parliament role vis vis the president and the executive for instance by granting it the right to no confidence vote on ministers and other officials appointed by the president or the right to control the work and the spending of the executive some more modest changes_ as well as draft law on local administration_ stipulating that the chairmen of raion district and city councils have to be elected by the councils by secret vote_ were adopted on may at first reading mr shevchuk is also promoting legislative initiate to transform the regional official tv pmr into public broadcasting institution on june the supreme soviet recommended that president smirnov dismiss the minister of justice victor balala balala_ who is one the closest allies of the president recently decided to transfer registration functions from his ministry to quasi commercial chamber of experts on july the moldovan parliament approved in two readings the law on the main provisions of special legal status for populated areas on the left bank of dniestr transnistria the law established an autonomous territorial unit which is an inseparable part of moldova and within the plenary powers established under the constitution and legislation of moldova decides on questions within its jurisdiction the law stipulates that populated localities on the left bank of the dniester may join transnistria or secede from it on the basis of local referenda and in conformity with the moldovan legislation in the light of this report_ pace adopted resolution in which it resolved_ inter alia_ that the assembly welcomes the resumption of negotiations following ukraine optimistic initiative of settling the transnistrian conflict by giving priority to democratisation it hopes that the current five member format_ involving moldova_ the transnistrian region_ russia_ ukraine and the osce_ will be extended to include also the council of europe it emphasises the need for effective supervision of the border between moldova and ukraine_ arms stocks and the production of armaments factories given their accumulated expertise_ the assembly wishes its rapporteurs to be associated with all these developments any settlement of the transnistrian conflict must be based on the inviolable principle of full respect for moldova territorial integrity and sovereignty in accordance with the rule of law_ any solution must accord with the popular will as expressed in fully free and democratic elections run by internationally recognised authorities the organisation for security and co operation in europe osce in its annual report for the osce referred to events in transdniestria as follows the most disruptive development_ however_ was the transdniestrian decision in mid july to close the moldovan schools in transdniestrian territory teaching in latin script in response_ the moldovan side suspended its participation in the five sided political settlement negotiations together with co mediators from the russian federation and ukraine_ the mission went to extraordinary lengths from mid july well into autumn to ameliorate the school crisis and to find and implement solution the mission also sought to defuse tensions between the sides concerning freedom of movement_ farmlands_ and railways in the osce also observed that only one train containing approximately tons of ammunition was removed from the operative group of russian forces depots in transdniestria in approximately metric tons of ammunition remain to be removed_ together with more than small arms and light weapons and approximately ten trainloads of miscellaneous military equipment the mission continued to co ordinate technical and financial assistance to the russian federation for these activities the

held consultations with representatives from chisinau and tiraspol in january_ may and september at the may meeting_ ukraine introduced president victor yushchenko settlement plan_ toward settlement through democratization this initiative envisages democratization of the transdniestrian region through internationally conducted elections to the regional legislative body_ along with steps to promote transparency and increased confidence in july_ the moldovan parliament_ citing the ukrainian plan_ adopted law on the basic principles of special legal status of transdniestria during consultations in september in odessa_ chisinau and tiraspol agreed to invite the eu and us to participate as observers in the negotiations formal negotiations resumed in an enlarged format in october after month break and continued in december following the osce ministerial council in ljubljana on december_ the presidents of ukraine and the russian federation_ victor yushchenko and vladimir putin_ issued joint statement welcoming the resumption of negotiations on the settlement of the transdniestrian conflict in september_ presidents voronin and yushchenko jointly requested the osce chairman in office to consider sending an international assessment mission iam to analyse democratic conditions in transdniestria and necessary steps for conducting democratic elections in the region in parallel_ the osce mission conducted technical consultations and analyses on basic requirements for democratic elections in the transdniestrian region_ as proposed in the yushchenko plan at the october negotiating round_ the osce chairmanship was asked to continue consultations on the possibility of organizing an iam to the transdniestrian region together with military experts from the russian federation and ukraine_ the osce mission completed development of package of proposed confidence and security building measures_ which were presented by the three mediators in july the mission subsequently began consultations on the package with representatives of chisinau and tiraspol the october negotiating round welcomed possible progress on enhancing transparency through mutual exchange of military data_ as envisaged in elements of this package on the question of russian military withdrawal_ the osce observed there was no withdrawal of russian arms and equipment from the transniestrian region during roughly metric tons of ammunition remain to be removed the commander of the operative group of russian forces reported in may that surplus stocks of small arms and light weapons stored by russian forces in the transdniestrian region have been destroyed the osce has not been allowed to verify these claims in the osce reported as follows the september independence referendum and the december presidential elections in transnistria neither one recognized nor monitored by the osce shaped the political environment of this work to spur on the settlement talks_ the mission drafted in early documents that suggested possible delimitation of competencies between central and regional authorities mechanism for monitoring factories in the transnistrian military industrial complex plan for the exchange of military data and an assessment mission to evaluate conditions and make recommendations for democratic elections in transnistria the transnistrian side_ however_ refused to continue negotiations after the march introduction of new customs rules for transnistrian exports_ and thus no progress could be made including on these projects attempts to unblock this stalemate through consultations among the mediators osce_ russian federation and ukraine and the observers european union and the united states of america in april_ may and november and consultations of the mediators and observers with each of the sides separately in october were to no avail on november_ group of osce heads of delegations_ along with osce mission members gained

leader igor smirnov met in april for the first time in seven years and followed up with another meeting on december mediators from the osce_ russian federation and ukraine and observers from the european union and the united states met five times informal meetings of the sides with mediators and observers took place five times these and additional shuttle diplomacy efforts by the mission formal negotiations in the format were not resumed there were no withdrawals of russian ammunition or equipment from the transistrian region during the voluntary fund retains sufficient resources to complete withdrawal tasks international non governmental organisations in its report dated june moldova regional tensions over transdniestria europe report no the international crisis group icg found as follows extract from the executive summary russia support for the self proclaimed and unrecognised dniestrian moldovan republic dmr has prevented resolution of the conflict and inhibited moldova progress towards broader integration into european political and economic structures in its recent and largely unilateral attempts to resolve the transdniestrian conflict_ russia has demonstrated almost cold war mindset despite comforting rhetoric regarding russian european union eu relations and russian cooperation on conflict resolution and peacekeeping within the newly independent states of the former soviet union nis old habits appear to die hard russia remains reluctant to see the eu_ or the organisation for security and cooperation in europe osce play an active role in resolving the conflict because moldova is still viewed by many in moscow as sphere of exclusively russian geopolitical interest it has not been difficult for russia to exploit moldova political and economic instability for its own interests despite having accepted concrete deadlines for withdrawing its troops_ russia has repeatedly back pedalled while trying to force through political settlement that would have ensured_ through unbalanced constitutional arrangements_ continued russian influence on moldovan policymaking and prolongation of its military presence in peacekeeping guise it has so far been unwilling to use its influence on the dmr mrt leadership to promote an approach to conflict resolution that balances the legitimate interests of all parties ukrainian and moldovan business circles have become adept at using the parallel dmr economy to their own ends_ regularly participating in re export and other illegal practices some have used political influence to prevent_ delay_ and obstruct decisions which could have put pressure on the dmr leadership to compromise these include abolition of tax and customs regulations favourable to the illegal re export business_ enforcement of effective border and customs control_ and collection of customs and taxes at internal borders with backing from russian_ ukrainian and moldovan economic elites_ the dmr leadership has become more assertive recognising that international recognition is unlikely_ it has focused on preserving de facto independence through loose confederation with moldova unfortunately_ dmr leaders taking advantage of contradictions in the tax and customs systems of moldova and the dmr continue to draw substantial profits from legal and illegal economic activities including re exports_ smuggling and arms production the dmr has become self aware actor with its own interests and strategies_ possessing limited scope for independent political manoeuvre but an extensive web of economic and other links across russia_ moldova_ and ukraine however_ it remains heavily dependent on russian political and economic support and does not like to put itself in position where it must act counter to russian policy russian and dmr interests often overlap but in some instances dmr leaders have been able to design and implement strategies to avoid russian pressure_ delay negotiations_ obstruct russian initiatives_ and undermine russian policies by playing up disagreements between the co mediators and capitalising on alternative sources of external support russia most recent attempt to enforce settlement the kozak memorandum in october and november has shown that its influence_ while pervasive_ has clear limits russia is unable to push through settlement without the support of moldova and the international community_ especially key players such as the osce_ eu_ and the comprehensive political settlement requires an approach that can bridge the differences between russia and other key international actors while fairly considering the interests of both the moldovan government and the dmr despite an understanding that russia should not be antagonised_ the gravitational pull of european integration is strong in moldova recently_ even its communist leadership has stressed the need to do more to achieve that goal the country has rarely been on western radar screens during the last decade_ however_ and it will need more demonstrable eu and backing if it is to resist russian political and material support for the dmr and transdniestrian obstruction of the negotiation process international actors must also help moldova to secure its own borders against the illicit economic activities which keep transdniestria afloat and affect its european neighbours as well the conflict can only be resolved if the international community uses its influence on russia bilaterally and within the osce only then_ and with substantially more determined commitment to political_ economic and administrative reform on its own part_ will moldova be able to realise its european aspirations comprehensive strategy towards moldova_ ukraine and russia within the eu wider europe policy would be critical first step in its report of august moldova uncertain future europe report no the icg observed extract from the executive summary with romania expected entry into the european union in the eu will share border with moldova_ weak state divided by conflict and plagued by corruption and organised crime moldova leadership has declared its desire to join the eu_ but its commitment to european values is suspect_ and efforts to resolve its dispute with the breakaway region of transdniestria have failed to end damaging stalemate that has persisted for fifteen years young people have little confidence in the country future and are leaving at an alarming rate if moldova is to become stable part of the eu neighbourhood_ there will need to be much greater international engagement_ not only in conflict resolution but in spurring domestic reforms to help make the country more attractive to its citizens two recent initiatives by the eu and ukraine gave rise to hopes that the balance of forces in the separatist dispute had changed significantly an eu border assistance mission eubam launched in late has helped curb smuggling along the transdniestrian segment of the moldova ukraine frontier_ key source of revenue for the authorities in tiraspol_ the transdniestrian capital at the same time_ kiev implementation of landmark customs regime to assist moldova in regulating transdniestrian exports has reduced the ability of businesses in the breakaway region to operate without moldovan oversight_ striking major psychological blow but optimism that these measures would ultimately force transdniestria to make diplomatic concessions appears to have been false although eubam has had significant success_ particularly given its small size and budget_ widespread smuggling continues nor has the ukrainian customs regime had decisive effect on transdniestrian businesses_ which remain capable of profitable legal trade as they were in the past moreover_ domestic political uncertainty has raised questions about whether kiev will continue to enforce the new regulations russia has increased its support for transdniestria_ sending economic aid and taking punitive measures against moldova_ including crippling ban on wine exports_ one of its main revenue sources moscow refuses to withdraw troops based in transdniestria since soviet times whose presence serves to preserve the status quo with russian support_ the transdniestrian leader_ igor smirnov_ has little incentive to compromise in his drive toward independence the internationally mediated negotiations between the two parties are going nowhere_ despite the presence since of the eu and as observers although some understanding had been reached about the level of autonomy in settlement_ moldova has hardened its position to match transdniestria intransigence in its report entitled freedom in the world freedom house commented_ inter alia moldova rejected russian backed federalization plan in november after it drew public protests the latest round of formal multilateral talks collapsed in early and transnistrian referendum voters in september overwhelmingly backed course of independence with the goal of eventually joining russia_ although the legitimacy of the vote was not recognized by moldova or the international community in the absence of active negotiations_ voronin pursued bilateral talks with russia and took number of steps to bring moldova foreign policy into line with the kremlin for much of he urged russia to accept proposal whereby transnistria would receive substantial autonomy within moldova_ strong and unitary presence in the moldovan parliament_ and the right to secede if moldova were to unite with romania in the future russian property rights would be respected_ and russian troops would be replaced by civilian observers voronin defended his separate consultations with russia by saying that any settlement would be finalized in the format the transnistria issue took on an added degree of urgency in august after russia fought brief conflict with georgia and recognized the independence of two breakaway regions there russian officials said they had no plans to recognize the pmr mrt but warned moldova not to adopt georgia confrontational stance the moldovan government in turn rejected any comparison and repeated its commitment to peaceful negotiations some experts expressed concerns that russia could impose harsh settlement on moldova in the bilateral talks and then recognize the pmr if the plan were rejected transnistrian president igor smirnov relations with voronin remained tense throughout the year_ as the moldovan leader effectively negotiated over smirnov head and expressed clear frustration with the pmr leadership the two men met in april for the first time since then again in december days after the april meeting_ romanian president traian basescu indirectly raised the prospect of partition in which ukraine would absorb transnistria and romania would annex moldova proper_ prompting voronin to accuse him of sabotaging the negotiations meanwhile_ russian president dmitri medvedev met with voronin and smirnov separately during the year political rights and civil of transnistria cannot elect their leaders democratically_ and they are unable to participate freely in moldovan elections corruption and organized crime are serious problems in transnistria the media environment is restrictive religious freedom is restricted although several thousand students study moldovan using the latin script_ this practice is restricted the moldovan language and latin alphabet are associated with support for unity with moldova_ while russian and the cyrillic alphabet are associated with separatist goals parents who send their children to schools using latin script_ and the schools themselves_ have faced routine harassment from the security services the authorities severely restrict freedom of assembly and rarely issue required permits for public protests the judiciary is subservient to the executive and generally implements the will of the authorities authorities discriminate against ethnic moldovans_ who make up about percent of the population it is believed that ethnic russians and ukrainians together comprise slim majority_ and as many as third of the region residents reportedly hold russian passports iii relevant international lawa international law materials concerning state responsibility for unlawful acts the international law commission draft articles on the responsibility of states for internationally wrongful acts the international law commission ilc adopted its draft articles on the responsibility of states for internationally wrongful acts draft articles in august articles and of chapter ii of the draft articles provide article conduct of organs placed at the disposal of state by another statethe conduct of an organ placed at the disposal of state by another state shall be considered an act of the former state under international law if the organ is acting in the exercise of elements of the governmental authority of the state at whose disposal it is placed article conduct directed or controlled by statethe conduct of person or group of persons shall be considered an act of state under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of_ or under the direction or control of that state in carrying out the conduct case law of the international court of justice icj in its advisory opinion legal consequences for states of the continued presence of south africa in namibia_ notwithstanding security council resolution the icj held_ on the obligation under international law to put an end to an illegal situation having reached these conclusions_ the court will now address itself to the legal consequences arising for states from the continued presence of south africa in namibia_ notwithstanding security council resolution binding determination made by competent organ of the united nations to the effect that situation is illegal cannot remain without consequence once the court is faced with such situation_ it would be failing in the discharge of its judicial functions if it did not declare that there is an obligation_ especially upon members of the united nations_ to bring that situation to an end as this court has held_ referring to one of its decisions declaring situation as contrary to rule of international law this decision entails legal consequence_ namely that of putting an end to an illegal situation reports south africa_ being responsible for having created and maintained situation which the court has found to have been validly declared illegal_ has the obligation to put an end to it it is therefore under obligation to withdraw its administration from the territory of namibia by maintaining the present illegal situation_ and occupying the territory without title_ south africa incurs international arising from continuing violation of an international obligation it also remains accountable for any violations of its international obligations_ or of the rights of the people of namibia the fact that south africa no longer has any title to administer the territory does not release it from its obligations and under international law towards other states in respect of the exercise of its powers in relation to this territory physical control of territory_ and not sovereignty or legitimacy of title_ is the basis of state liability for acts affecting other states in the case concerning the application of the convention on the prevention and punishment of genocide bosnia and herzegovina serbia and montenegro judgment of february the icj held_ on the question of state responsibility the first issue raised by this argument is whether it is possible in principle to attribute to state conduct of persons or groups of persons who_ while they do not have the legal status of state organs_ in fact act under such strict control by the state that they must be treated as its organs for purposes of the necessary attribution leading to the state responsibility for an internationally wrongful act the court has in fact already addressed this question_ and given an answer to it in principle_ in its judgment of june in the case concerning military and paramilitary activities in and against nicaragua nicaragua united states of america merits_ judgment_ reports pp in paragraph of that judgment the court stated that it had to determine whether or not the relationship of the contras to the united states government was so much one of dependence on the one side and control on the other that it would be right to equate the contras_ for legal purposes_ with an organ of the united states government_ or as acting on behalf of that government then_ examining the facts in the light of the information in its possession_ the court observed that there is no clear evidence of the united states having actually exercised such degree of control in all fields as to justify treating the contras as acting on its behalf para and went on to conclude that the evidence available to the court is insufficient to demonstrate the contras complete dependence on united states aid so that the court was unable to determine that the contra force may be equated for legal purposes with the forces of the united states pp para the passages quoted show that_ according to the court jurisprudence_ persons_ groups of persons or entities may_ for purposes of international responsibility_ be equated with state organs even if that status does not follow from internal law_ provided that in fact the persons_ groups or entities act in complete dependence on the state_ of which they are ultimately merely the instrument in such case_ it is appropriate to look beyond legal status alone_ in order to grasp the reality of the relationship between the person taking action_ and the state to which he is so closely attached as to appear to be nothing more than its agent any other solution would allow states to escape their international responsibility by choosing to act through persons or entities whose supposed independence would be purely fictitious however_ so to equate persons or entities with state organs when they do not have that status under internal law must be exceptional_ for it requires proof of particularly great degree of state control over them_ relationship which the court judgment quoted above expressly described as complete dependence the icj went on to find that serbia was not directly responsible for genocide during the bosnian war it held nonetheless that serbia had violated its positive obligation to prevent genocide_ under the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide_ by failing to take all measures within its power to stop the genocide that occurred in srebrenica in july and by having failed to transfer ratko mladić_ indicted for genocide and complicity in genocide_ for trial by the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia treaty provisions concerning the right to education the universal declaration of human rights article of the universal declaration of human rights provides everyone has the right to education education shall be free_ at least in the elementary and fundamental stages elementary education shall be compulsory technical and professional education shall be made generally available and higher education shall be

as regards the applicant allegations the position of the government as noted in the reports adopted following certain international inquiries alleged secret detentions and unlawful inter state transfers of detainees involving council of europe member states_ doc june the marty report on december the president of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe asked the assembly committee on legal affairs and human rights to investigate allegations of extraordinary renditions in europe senator dick marty of switzerland was appointed as special rapporteur on june the assembly published the marty report it set out_ on the basis of meetings that took place between and april the position of the macedonian authorities regarding the applicant case it stated_ inter alia the position of the authorities the official line of the macedonian government was first contained in letter from the minister of interior to the ambassador of the european commission dated december in its simplest form_ it essentially contains four items of information according to police records first_ mr el masri arrived by bus at the macedonian border crossing of tabanovce at on december second_ he was interviewed by authorised police officials who suspected possession of falsified travel document third_ approximately five hours later_ mr el masri was allowed entrance into macedonia_ apparently freely and fourth_ on january he left macedonia over the border crossing of blace into kosovo the president of the republic set out firm stance in the very first meeting with the european parliament delegation_ providing strong disincentive to any official who may have wished to break ranks by expressing an independent viewpoint up to this moment_ would like to assure you that have not come across any reason not to believe the official position of our ministry of interior have no additional comments or facts_ from any side_ to convince me that what has been established in the official report of our ministry is not the truth on friday april the official position was presented in far greater detail during meeting with the head of the ubk_ macedonia main intelligence service_ at the time of the el masri case he stated that the ubk department for control and professional standards had undertaken an investigation into the case and traced official records of all mr el masri contact with the macedonian authorities the further details as presented by the head of the ubk are summarized as follows mr el masri arrived on the macedonian border on december new year eve the ministry of interior had intensified security for the festive period and was operating higher state of alert around the possible criminal activity in line with these more intense activities_ bus passengers were being subjected to thorough security check_ including an examination of their identity documents upon examining mr el masri passport_ the macedonian border police developed certain suspicions and decided to detain him in order not to make the other passengers wait at the border_ the bus was at this point allowed to continue its journey the objective of holding mr el masri was to conduct an interview with him_ which according to the head of the ubk was carried out in accordance with all applicable european standards members of the ubk_ the security and counter intelligence service_ are present at all border points in macedonia as part of what is described as integrated border management and security ubk officials participated in the interview of mr el masri the officials enquired into mr el masri reasons for travelling into the country_ where he intended to stay and whether he was carrying sufficient amounts of money the head of the ubk explained think these were all standard questions that are asked in the context of such routine procedure don think need to go into further details at the same time_ macedonian officials undertook preliminary visual examination of mr el masri travel documents they suspected that the passport might be faked or forged noting in particular that mr el masri was born in kuwait_ yet claimed to possess german citizenship further passport check was carried out against an interpol database the border point at tabanovce is not linked to interpol network_ so the information had to be transmitted to skopje_ from where an electronic request was made to the central interpol database in lyon ubk official in the analytical department apparently made this request using an electronic code_ so the macedonian authorities can produce no record of it mr el masri was made to wait on the border point while the interpol search was carried out when it was established that there existed no interpol warrant against mr el masri and no further grounds on which to hold him_ he was released he then left the border point at tabanovce_ although macedonian officials were not able to describe how asked directly about this point in separate meeting_ the minister of interior said we re not able to tell you exactly what happened to him after he was released because it is not in our interest after the person leaves the border crossing_ we re not in position to know how he traveled further the ministry of interior subsequently established that mr el masri had stayed at hotel in skopje called the skopski merak mr el masri is said to have checked in on the evening of december and registered in the guest book he stayed for nights_ including daily breakfast_ and checked out on january the ministry then conducted further check on all border crossings and discovered that on the same day_ january in the evening_ mr el masri left the territory of macedonia over the border crossing at blace_ into the territory of kosovo when asked whether mr el masri had received stamp to indicate his departure by this means_ the head of the ubk answered normally there should be stamp on the passport as you cross the border out of macedonia_ but can be sure unmik united nations administration mission in kosovo is also present on the kosovo border and is in charge of the protocol on that side my ubk colleague has just informed me that he has crossed the border at blace twice in recent times and didn receive stamp on either occasion what is not said in the official version is the fact that the macedonian ubk routinely consults with the cia on such matters which_ on certain level_ is quite comprehensible and logical according to confidential information we received of which we know the source full description of mr el masri was transmitted to the cia via its bureau chief in skopje for an analysis did the person in question have contact with terrorist movements_ in particular with al qaeda based on the intelligence material about khaled el masri in its possession the content of which is not known to us the cia answered in the affirmative the ubk_ as the local partner organisation_ was requested to assist in securing and detaining mr el masri until he could be handed over to the cia for transfer council of europe_ report by the secretary general under article of the convention on the question of secret detention and transport of detainees suspected of terrorist acts_ notably by or at the instigation of foreign agencies sg inf february on november the secretary general of the

alleged infringements of convention rights and on whether public officials who had allegedly been involved in acts or omissions leading to such deprivation of liberty of detainees had been or were being investigated on february and april the government replied to this request in the latter submission_ the government stated their position as regards the applicant case they stated_ inter alia as far as the case of mr khaled el masri is concerned_ we would like to inform you that this case was examined by the ministry of internal affairs_ and the information about it was sent to the representatives of the european commission in the republic of macedonia_ to the director for western balkans in the dg directorate general enlargement of the european commission in brussels and to members of the european parliament as early as june he ministry of internal affairs of the republic of macedonia informs that_ based on the police records on entry and exit at the state border of the republic of macedonia_ mr khaled el masri arrived_ by bus_ at the tabanovce border crossing from the state union of serbia and montenegro on december at presenting german passport suspecting possession of forged travel document_ the competent police officers checked the document and interviewed mr khaled el masri at the border crossing check in the interpol records was also carried out which showed that no international arrest warrant had been issued for mr el masri mr khaled el masri was allowed to enter the republic of macedonia on december at according to the police records_ mr khaled el masri left the republic of macedonia on january at the blace border crossing to the state union of serbia and montenegro on the kosovo section the version of events submitted by the government in the proceedings before the court the government confirmed their version of events as outlined above see paragraphs and above they denied that the applicant had been detained and ill treated by state agents in the hotel_ that he had been handed over to cia agents_ and that the latter had ill treated him at skopje airport and transferred him to cia run prison in afghanistan in their submission_ the applicant had freely entered_ stayed in and left the territory of the respondent state the only contact with state agents had occurred on december on the occasion of his entry into the respondent state_ when enquiries had been undertaken regarding the validity of his passport there had been no other contact with state agents during his entire stay in the respondent state the enquiries by the ministry of the interior demonstrated that the applicant had stayed in the respondent state by his own choice and free will between december and january when he had freely left the state through the blace border crossing in support of their argument_ they submitted copy of the following documents extracts from the official border crossing records for tabanovce and blace an extract from the hotel guest book in which the applicant had been registered as guest occupying room number between december and january and two letters of february in which the hotel manager_ firstly_ had communicated to the ministry of the interior the names of six persons who had been on duty in the hotel at the relevant time and_ secondly_ had denied that any person had ever stayed in the hotel involuntarily it was further specified that the person whose photograph was on the hotel website see paragraph above was mr who could be found in the hotel they also produced letter of february in which the macedonian ministry of transport civil aviation administration had informed the ministry of the interior that on january boeing aircraft flying from palma de mallorca spain registered as flight no p_ had been given permission to land at skopje airport_ that the same aircraft had received permission at to take off on the same day to kabul afghanistan and that at on

they provided copy of police record of the applicant apprehension at the tabanovce border crossing on december as specified in the record_ the applicant had been held between and the record does not state the reasons for his apprehension_ but it contains an incomplete handwritten note that he was apprehended on the basis of tel no of december international inquiries relating to the applicant case there have been number of international inquiries into allegations of extraordinary renditions in europe and the involvement of european governments the reports have referred to the applicant case parliamentary assembly of the council of europe the marty inquiry the marty report the marty report see paragraph above stated_ inter alia draft resolution the facts and information gathered to date_ along with new factual patterns in the process of being uncovered_ indicate that the key elements of this spider web have notably included worldwide network of secret detentions on cia black sites and in military or naval installations the cia programme of renditions under which terrorist suspects are flown between states on civilian aircraft_ outside of the scope of any legal protections_ often to be handed over to states who customarily resort to degrading treatment and torture and the use of military airbases and aircraft to transport detainees as human cargo to guantánamo bay in cuba or to other detention centres attempts to expose the true nature and extent of these unlawful operations have invariably faced obstruction or dismissal_ from the united states and its european partners alike the authorities of most council of europe member states have denied their participation_ in many cases without actually having carried out any inquiries or serious investigations explanatory memorandum cia methodology how detainee is treated during rendition collectively_ the cases in the report testify to the existence of an established modus operandi of rendition_ put into practice by an elite_ highly trained and highly disciplined group of cia agents conclusion whilst hard evidence_ at least according to the strict meaning of the word_ is still not forthcoming_ number of coherent and converging elements indicate that secret detention centres have indeed existed and unlawful inter state transfers have taken place in europe skopje airport was categorised in the marty report as one off pick up point that is_ point from which one detainee or one group of detainees was picked up for rendition or unlawful transfer_ but not as part of systemic occurrence as to the applicant case_ the marty report stated_ inter alia specific examples of documented renditions khaled el masri we spoke for many hours with khaled el masri_ who also testified publicly before the temporary committee of the european parliament_ and we find credible his account of detention in macedonia and afghanistan for nearly five months elements of corroboration for mr el masri account mr el masri account is borne out by numerous items of evidence_ some of which cannot yet be made public because they have been declared secret_ or because they are covered by the confidentiality of the investigation under way in the office of the munich prosecuting authorities following mr el masri complaint of abduction the items already in the public domain are cited in the afore mentioned memorandum submitted to the virginia court in which mr el masri lodged his complaint passport stamps confirming mr el masri entry to and exit from macedonia_ as well as exit from albania_ on the dates in question scientific testing of mr el masri hair follicles_ conducted pursuant to german criminal investigation_ that is consistent with mr el masri account that he spent time in south asian country and was deprived of food for an extended period of time other physical evidence_ including mr el masri passport_ the two shirts he was given by his american captors on departing from afghanistan_ his boarding pass from tirana to frankfurt_ and number of keys that mr el masri possessed during his ordeal_ all of which have been turned over to german prosecutors aviation logs confirming that boeing business jet owned and operated by defendants in this case us based corporation_ premier executive transportation services_ inc and operated by another us based corporation_ aero contractors limited then registered by the faa us federal aviation administration as p_ took off from palma_ majorca_ spain on january landed at skopje airport at that evening and left skopje more than three hours later_ flying to baghdad and then on to kabul_ the afghan capital database of aircraft movements_ compiled on the basis of information obtained from various sources_ was attached to the marty report witness accounts from other passengers on the bus from germany to macedonia_ which confirm mr el masri account of his detention at the border photographs of the hotel in skopje where mr el masri was detained for days_ from which mr el masri has identified both his actual room and staff member who served him food geological records that confirm mr el masri recollection of minor earthquakes during his detention in afghanistan evidence of the identity of sam whom mr el masri has positively identified from photographs and police line up_ and who media reports confirm is german intelligence officer with links to foreign intelligence services sketches that mr el masri drew of the layout of the afghan prison_ which were immediately recognisable to another rendition victim who was detained by the us in afghanistan photographs taken immediately upon mr el masri return to germany that are consistent with his account of weight loss and unkempt grooming one could_ with sufficient application_ begin to tease out discrepancies in the official line for example_ the ministry of interior stated that the hotel owner should have the record of mr el masri bill while the hotel owner responded to several nquiries_ by telephone and in person_ by saying that the record had been handed over to the ministry of interior all these factual elements indicate that the cia carried out rendition of khaled el masri the plane in question had finished transferring another detainee just two days earlier and the plane was still on the same rendition circuit the plane and its crew had spent the interim period at palma de mallorca_ popular cia staging point the physical and moral degradation to which mr el masri was subjected before being forced aboard the plane in macedonia corresponds with the cia systematic rendition methodology described earlier in this report the destination of the flight carrying mr el masri_ kabul_ forms hub of cia secret detentions in our graphic representation of the spider web it is worth repeating that the analysis of all facts concerning this case points in favour of the credibility of el masri everything points in the direction that he was the victim of abduction and ill treatment amounting to torture within the meaning of the term established by the case law of the united nations committee against torture secret detentions and illegal transfers of detainees involving council of europe member states second report_ doc rev june the marty report in his report of june senator marty stated_ inter alia some european governments have obstructed the search for the truth and are continuing to do so by invoking the concept of state secrets secrecy is invoked so as not to provide explanations to parliamentary bodies or to prevent judicial authorities from establishing the facts and prosecuting those guilty of offences the same approach led the authorities of the former yugoslav republic of macedonia to hide the truth and give an obviously false account of the actions of its own national agencies and the cia in carrying out the secret detention and rendition of khaled el masri we believe we have now managed to retrace in detail mr el masri odyssey and to shed light on his return to europe if we_ with neither the powers nor resources_ were able to do so_ why were the competent authorities unable to manage it there is only one possible explanation they are not interested in seeing the truth come out we were able to prove the involvement of the cia in mr el masri transfer to afghanistan by linking the flight that carried him there on the aircraft p_ flying from skopje the former yugoslav republic of macedonia to baghdad iraq to kabul afghanistan on january to another known cia detainee transfer on the same plane two days earlier_ thus establishing the first rendition circuit upon mr el masri arrival in afghanistan_ he was taken to cia secret detention facility near kabul and held in small_ filthy_ concrete cell for period of over four months during this period the cia discovered that no charges could be brought against him and that his passport was genuine_ but inexplicably kept mr el masri in his squalid_ solitary confinement for several weeks thereafter today think am in position to reconstruct the circumstances of mr el masri return from afghanistan he was flown out of kabul on may on board cia chartered gulfstream aircraft with the tail number rk to military airbase in albania called bezat kuçova aerodrome the official version of mr el masri involuntary stay in the former yugoslav republic of macedonia has definitely become utterly untenable european parliament the fava inquiry on january the european parliament set up temporary committee on extraordinary rendition and appointed mr claudio fava as rapporteur with mandate to investigate the alleged existence of cia prisons in europe the fava inquiry held meetings and sent delegations to the former yugoslav republic of macedonia_ the united states of america_ germany_ the united kingdom_ romania_ poland and portugal it identified at least flights operated by the cia in european airspace between the end of and the end of during its visit to the former yugoslav republic of macedonia_ the inquiry met with high ranking officials on july the european parliament adopted resolution on the alleged use of european countries by the cia for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners ini doc which stated_ inter alia the european parliament condemns the abduction by the cia of the german national_ khaled el masri who was held in afghanistan from january to may and subjected to degrading and inhuman treatment notes further the suspicion not yet allayed that khaled el masri was illegally held before that date_ from december to january in the former yugoslav republic of macedonia and that he was transported from there to afghanistan on january considers the measures that the former yugoslav republic of macedonia claims to have taken to investigate the matter to be inadequate condemns the fact that the german national_ khaled el masri_ was held illegally in afghanistan for more than four months in deplores the reluctance of the authorities of the former yugoslav republic of macedonia to confirm that el masri was in skopje and was probably being held there before his rendition to afghanistan by cia agents on january the final report on the alleged use of european countries by the cia for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners ini doc was published noting the lack of thorough investigation by the respondent state_ the report stated_ inter alia the european parliament condemns the extraordinary rendition of the german citizen khaled el masri_ abducted at the border crossing tabanovce in the former yugoslav republic of macedonia on december illegally held in skopje from december to january and then transported to afghanistan on january where he was held until may and subjected to degrading and inhuman treatment fully endorses the preliminary findings of munich public prosecutor martin hofmann that there is no evidence on the basis of which to refute khaled el masri version of events the report also emphasised that the concept of secret detention facility includes not only prisons_ but also places where somebody is held incommunicado_ such as private apartments_ police stations or hotel rooms_ as in the case of khaled el masri in skopje united nations human rights committee_ concluding observations on the former yugoslav republic of macedonia_ april un doc ccpr mkd co in the course of the periodic review of the respondent state compliance with the international covenant on civil and political rights conducted by the united nations human rights committee during its march to april session_ the latter noted the investigation undertaken by the state party and its denial of any involvement in the applicant rendition notwithstanding the highly detailed allegations as well as the concerns raised by the marty and fava inquiries the united nations human rights committee made the following recommendation the state party should consider undertaking new and comprehensive investigation of the allegations made by mr khaled el masri the investigation should take account of all available evidence and seek the cooperation of mr el masri himself this recommendation was supported by the commissioner for human rights of the council of europe in his report published on september council of europe commissioner for human rights_ thomas hammarberg_ report on visit to the former yugoslav republic of macedonia_ february the applicant petition before the inter american commission on human rights against the united states of america on april the applicant filed petition with the inter american commission on human rights on august the commission transmitted the petition to the us government for comments no further information has been provided in respect of these proceedings relevant proceedings before national authorities other than those of the respondent state germany investigation by the german prosecuting authorities on an unspecified date in the munich public prosecutor office opened an investigation into the applicant allegations that he had been unlawfully abducted_ detained_ physically and psychologically abused and interrogated in the former yugoslav republic of macedonia and afghanistan according to the applicant_ number of investigative steps were taken_ including an examination of eyewitnesses who confirmed that the applicant had travelled to the former yugoslav republic of macedonia by bus at the end of and that he had been detained shortly after entering that state furthermore_ radioactive isotope analysis of the applicant hair was carried out an expert report of january stated_ inter alia it is very likely that the changes observed in the enclosed isotopic signatures of the applicant hair indeed correspond to the applicant statements according to the first committee of inquiry of the german bundestag see paragraphs below the radioisotope analysis also confirmed that the applicant had undergone two hunger strikes on january the munich public prosecutor issued arrest warrants for thirteen cia agents on account of their involvement in the applicant alleged rendition the names of the people sought were not made public the identities of the cia agents were allegedly given to the german prosecutor by the spanish authorities_ which had uncovered them in the course of their investigation into the use of spanish airports by the cia german parliamentary inquiry on april the german bundestag federal parliament appointed the first committee of inquiry of the sixteenth legislative period the committee of inquiry to review the activities of the secret services over period of investigation of years_ the committee of inquiry held total of sessions_ areas of investigation were addressed and total of witnesses were heard_ including the applicant the findings of the committee of inquiry were made public on june the committee of inquiry report_ which runs altogether to pages_ stated_ inter alia khaled el masri report on his imprisonment in macedonia and in afghanistan is credible as to the core facts of his detention in macedonia and his transfer to afghanistan_ as well as his confinement there by united states forces doubts remain_ however_ about some specific aspects of his account the police investigations conducted by swabian law enforcement authorities and supported by the bka german federal criminal police reaffirm mr el masri account his trip to macedonia on december was corroborated by witnesses el masri account of the transfer from macedonia to afghanistan by united states forces is consistent with subsequent reports from other victims of the excesses of the war on terror by the united states government at the time the recorded movement of an american boeing of the presumed cia airline aero contractors that flew from majorca to skopje on january and continued on to kabul matches the temporal information that mr el masri provided on the duration of his confinement at macedonian hotel all this supports the committee profound doubts about the official macedonian version of the events the macedonian government continue to deny his detention at the hotel and his transfer to afghanistan_ calling this defamatory media campaign this official account of the events by macedonia is clearly incorrect rather_ it must be concluded that convincing evidence exists for el masri account of the course of his arrest and transfer outside the country according to the report_ doubts remained about the actual purpose of the applicant trip to skopje and significant discrepancies were noted in his statements concerning his questioning in the former yugoslav republic of macedonia and afghanistan_ in particular his suspicion as to the german background of sam legal action in the united states of america on december the american civil liberties union aclu filed claim on behalf of the applicant in the us district court for the eastern district of virginia against number of defendants_ including the former cia director george tenet and certain unknown cia agents the claim alleged that the applicant had been deprived of his liberty in the absence of legal process and included claim under the alien tort statute ats for violations of international legal norms prohibiting prolonged arbitrary detention and cruel_ inhuman or degrading treatment in may the district court dismissed the applicant claim_ finding that the us government had validly asserted the state secrets privilege the district court held that the state interest in preserving state secrets outweighed the applicant individual interest in justice that decision was confirmed on appeal by the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit in october the supreme court refused to review the case proceedings taken in the former yugoslav republic of macedonia regarding the applicant alleged arrest_ confinement and ill treatment proceedings before the department for control and professional standards the dcps within the ministry of the interior in an internal inquiry was carried out into the applicant claims by the dcps within the ministry of the interior the applicant was not invited to produce any evidence before the dcps_ nor was he informed of the outcome of the investigation the results of this inquiry were not communicated to him_ but to the representatives of the european union in the respondent state see paragraph above after having been given notice of the instant case_ the government submitted copy of two reports issued on march and april by the dcps both reports were drawn up at the request of the public prosecutor department of organised crime and corruption_ which had acted on two separate legal assistance requests_ dated may and november respectively_ from the munich public prosecutor investigating the applicant criminal complaint in germany these reports reiterated the government version of events as described above they specified that the applicant_ after having arrived at the tabanovce border crossing on december had been held between and in the official border premises and interviewed by the macedonian police in connection with the alleged possession of forged passport after he had been released_ he had stayed in the hotel_ occupying room number he had paid the hotel bill and had left the respondent state_ as pedestrian_ at on january at the blace border crossing it was further specified that the then head of the ubk_ which had operated within the ministry of the interior_ had never been rewarded by any foreign agency_ including the cia it was concluded that no one_ including the applicant_ had ever been held in the hotel and interrogated by agents of the ministry of the interior in the course of these inquiries_ the ministry of the interior submitted to the macedonian public prosecutor the documents indicated above see paragraph criminal proceedings against unknown law enforcement officials on october the applicant_ through his legal representative mr medarski_ lodged criminal complaint with the skopje public prosecutor office against unidentified law enforcement officials on account of his unlawful detention and abduction_ offences punishable under article of the criminal code the complaint also alleged the crime of torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment_ punishable under articles and of the criminal code in support of his complaint_ the applicant submitted copy of his affidavit prepared for the purposes of his lawsuit in the united states of america and produced the following evidence copy of his passport relevant extracts from the and marty reports and the fava inquiry copy of the aviation logs letter from the skopje airport authorities issued on june in reply to the applicant request for information attesting that on january boeing aircraft registered by the faa as had landed at skopje airport without any passengers and that it had taken off on january carrying only one passenger translated version of the expert report on the applicant hair and sketches of the hotel room where the applicant had allegedly been detained the photograph of the waiter who had allegedly served the applicant with food was not included in the submission to the public prosecutor because the applicant had been unable to preserve copy at the relevant time and the photograph was no longer available on the hotel website the applicant further complained that_ while being held at the tabanovce border crossing and in the skopski merak hotel_ he had been denied the right to contact his family_ lawyer of his own choosing or representative of the german embassy on october the public prosecutor requested the ministry of the interior to investigate the applicant allegations_ and in particular to provide concrete information regarding the events at the tabanovce border crossing point_ the hotel and skopje airport in order to establish the truth on november the dcps confirmed its previous findings and reiterated that all documents had already been submitted to the public prosecutor office see paragraphs and above on december the public prosecutor rejected the applicant criminal complaint as unsubstantiated relying on the information submitted by the dcps_ the public prosecutor found no evidence that unidentified officials had committed the alleged crimes according to the applicant_ he was notified of that decision on november the government confirmed that_ during the investigation_ the public prosecutor had taken oral evidence from neither the applicant nor the personnel working in the hotel at the relevant time furthermore_ no steps had been taken to establish the purpose of the landing of the aircraft mentioned in the letter issued by the skopje airport authorities on june and attached to the applicant criminal complaint see paragraph above in the government view_ this was because the inquiries made by the ministry of the interior had rebutted the applicant implausible allegations furthermore_ during the inquiries the ministry had already interviewed the persons working in the hotel at the time see paragraphs and above they had produced consistent evidence however_ there had been no record of those interviews civil proceedings for damages on january mr medarski_ on behalf of the applicant_ brought civil action for damages against the state and the ministry of the interior in relation to his alleged unlawful abduction and ill treatment the claim was based on sections and of the obligations act see paragraphs and below the applicant claimed million macedonian denars equivalent to approximately euros in respect of the non pecuniary damage resulting from his physical and mental pain and the fear that he would be killed during his detention he reiterated his complaints that he had been denied the right to establish any contact with the outside world the fact that his family had had no information about his fate and whereabouts had added to his mental suffering that had amounted to separate violation of his family life under article of the convention he further argued that such actions by state agents amounted to violation of articles and of the convention besides the evidence submitted in his criminal complaint see paragraph above the applicant requested that the civil courts hear oral evidence from him and that psychological examination be carried out the government informed the court that sixteen hearings had so far been scheduled before the skopje

factual material from these and other reliable sources_ the assembly concludes that the circumstances surrounding detentions by the united states at guantánamo bay show unlawfulness and inconsistency with the rule of law_ on the following grounds vii the united states has_ by practising rendition removal of persons to other countries_ without judicial supervision_ for purposes such as interrogation or detention allowed detainees to be subjected to torture and to cruel_ inhuman or degrading treatment_ in violation of the prohibition on non refoulement parliamentary assembly of the council of europe_ resolution on enforced disappearances_ adopted on october the relevant parts of this resolution read as follows enforced disappearances entail deprivation of liberty_ refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or concealment of the fate and the whereabouts of the disappeared person and the placing of the person outside the protection of the law the parliamentary assembly unequivocally condemns enforced disappearance as very serious human rights violation on par with torture and murder_ and it is concerned that this humanitarian scourge has not yet been eradicated_ even in europe united nations general assembly resolution on torture and other cruel_ inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment_ adopted on december the relevant part of this resolution reads as follows the general assembly_ reminds all states that prolonged incommunicado detention or detention in secret places may facilitate the perpetration of torture and other cruel_ inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and can in itself constitute form of such treatment_ and urges all states to respect the safeguards concerning the liberty_ security and dignity of the person european commission for democracy through law venice commission opinion on the international legal obligations of council of europe member states in respect of secret detention facilities and inter state transport of prisoners no march the relevant parts of the venice commission opinion read as follows as regards the terminology used to refer to irregular transfer and detention of prisoners_ the venice commission notes that the public debate frequently uses the term rendition this is not term used in international law the term refers to one state obtaining custody over person suspected of involvement in serious crime terrorism in the territory of another state and or the transfer of such person to custody in the first state territory_ or place subject to its jurisdiction_ or to third state rendition is thus general term referring more to the result obtaining of custody over suspected person rather than the means whether particular rendition is lawful will depend upon the laws of the states concerned and on the applicable rules of international law_ in particular human rights law thus_ even if particular rendition is in accordance with the national law of one of the states involved which may not forbid or even regulate activities of state organs it may still be unlawful under the national law of the other state moreover_ rendition may be contrary to customary international law and treaty or customary obligations undertaken by the participating state under human rights law and or international humanitarian law the term extraordinary rendition appears to be used when there is little or no doubt that the obtaining of custody over person is not in accordance with the existing legal procedures applying in the state where the person was situated at the time as regards inter state transfers of prisoners there are only four legal ways for council of europe member states to transfer prisoner to foreign authorities deportation_ extradition_ transit and transfer of sentenced persons for the purpose of their serving the sentence in another country extradition and deportation proceedings must be defined by the applicable law_ and the prisoners must be

of the united nations special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism_ february un doc hrc in this report_ the special rapporteur noted the following the special rapporteur is concerned about situations where persons are detained for long period of time for the sole purpose of intelligence gathering or on broad grounds in the name of prevention these situations constitute arbitrary deprivation of liberty the existence of grounds for continued detention should be determined by an independent and impartial court without delay_ the continued detention of such person triggers duty for the authorities to establish whether criminal suspicions can be confirmed and_ if this is the case_ to bring charges against the suspect and to put him on trial the special rapporteur remains deeply troubled that the united states has created comprehensive system of extraordinary renditions_ prolonged and secret detention_ and practices that violate the prohibition against torture and other forms of ill treatment this system required an international web of exchange of information and has created corrupted body of information which was shared systematically with partners in the war on terror through intelligence cooperation_ thereby corrupting the institutional culture of the legal and institutional systems of recipient states the human rights obligations of states_ in particular the obligation to ensure an effective remedy_ require that such legal provisions must not lead to priori dismissal of investigations_ or prevent disclosure of wrongdoing_ in particular when there are reports of international crimes or gross human rights violations the blanket invocation of state secrets privilege with reference to complete policies_ such as the united states secret detention_ interrogation and rendition programme or third party intelligence under the policy of originator control prevents effective investigation and renders the right to remedy illusory this is incompatible with article of the international covenant on civil and political rights it could also amount to violation of the obligation of states to provide judicial assistance to investigations that deal with gross human rights violations and serious violations of international humanitarian law united nations human rights council_ resolutions and right to the truth_ adopted on september and october the relevant part of the above resolutions read as follows recognised the right of the victims of gross violations of

or omissions that amount to serious human rights violations they cover states obligations under the convention to take positive action in respect not only of their agents_ but also in respect of non state actors according to the guidelines_ impunity is caused or facilitated notably by the lack of diligent reaction of institutions or state agents to serious human rights violations states are to combat impunity as matter of justice for the victims_ as deterrent with respect to future human rights violations and in order to uphold the rule of law and public trust in the justice system they provide_ inter alia_ for the general measures that states should undertake in order to prevent impunity_ the duty to investigate_ as well as the adequate guarantees for persons deprived of their

knowledge_ prior to the current detention of prisoners at guantánamo_ the us government has never before asserted such grave and startling proposition accordingly_ we view guantánamo as unique not

anything else that would further explain the situation domestic proceedings on january the applicant counsel_ ms zegveld_ wrote via the registry of the military chamber to the public prosecution service attached to the regional court of arnhem on behalf of the next of kin of mr azhar sabah jaloud she asked to be informed of the outcome of the investigation into the latter death and any decisions made as to the prosecution of any suspects_ with view to bringing proceedings under article of the code of criminal procedure wetboek van strafvordering see below the public prosecutor replied on january stating that the investigation had been closed in june that mr azhar sabah jaloud had presumably vermoedelijk been hit by an iraqi bullet that the netherlands serviceman who had also fired at the vehicle was entitled to claim self defence and that for that reason no netherlands service personnel had been designated as suspects on february ms zegveld wrote to the public prosecutor asking_ among other things_ for the rules of engagement and any reports of investigations by the iraqi authorities to be added to the file the public prosecutor replied on february_ declining to accede to ms zegveld requests referring to the court chamber judgment in the case of ramsahai and others the netherlands_ no november he stated that since the procedure under article of the code of criminal procedure did not involve the determination of criminal charge article of the convention did not apply and so arrangements for access to the case file in such cases were different from those applicable in ordinary criminal proceedings on october the applicant_ represented by his counsel ms zegveld and mr pestman_ lodged request under article of the code of criminal procedure with the arnhem court of appeal for the prosecution of lieutenant he argued that there was nothing to support the suggestion that mr azhar sabah jaloud had been killed by an iraqi bullet that the number of shots fired by lieutenant reflected violence that lieutenant had failed to fire warning shot and had failed to heed sergeant teunissen order to cease firing that_ in accordance with article of the first additional protocol to the geneva conventions_ mr azhar sabah jaloud ought to have been considered civilian in the absence of any indications to the contrary and ought therefore not to have been subjected to aimed rifle fire and that the use of lethal force by lieutenant had been unnecessary in any event he also relied on the statement made to the iraqi police by the driver of the car_ to the effect that the latter had been told to keep quiet about the involvement of netherlands military personnel on january the chief public prosecutor hoofdofficier van justitie to the regional court of arnhem wrote to the chief advocate general hoofdadvocaat generaal to the court of appeal of arnhem_ recommending that the applicant request be dismissed he appended detailed statement by the public prosecutor who had taken the decision in july not to prosecute lieutenant according to the public prosecutor_ while it had to be accepted that lieutenant had fired at the car_ it could not be proved that lieutenant had caused the death of mr azhar sabah jaloud moreover_ even if such were the case_ lieutenant could reasonably have believed that he was under attack and needed to defend himself the public prosecutor statement also contained the following passage on the basis of united nations security council resolution the special of the united states and the united kingdom as occupying powers were recognised unlike the british forces_ however_ the netherlands were not to be considered an occupying power in iraq sfir counts as peacekeeping operation vredesoperatie for the netherlands the government point of view was that the role of the netherlands armed forces should remain limited to supporting the british in their appointed territory in southern iraq lower house of parliament_ no no the legitimisation for the use of functional force by sfir is not to be found in ius in bello_ but in the security council mandate_ the rules of engagement roe based thereon_ and the netherlands instruction card for the use of force which is derived from those the roe empower the use of force against any person who falls within the scope of the relevant rule accordingly_ in certain cases such persons may be civilians this also applies as the instruction for the use of force reflects to the inherent right of self defence the instructions and the objective of the commanding officer_ seen in connection with the perceived threat_ are decisive as to whether soldier will make use of his powers to use force_ and if so_ how the public prosecutor further argued that no violation of article of the convention under its procedural head could be found_ since the convention did not bind netherlands troops in iraq the netherlands troops had not exercised effective authority in iraq on february the advocate general to the court of appeal of arnhem submitted written opinion expressing the provisional opinion that the decision not to prosecute had been sound netherlands serviceman remained subject to netherlands criminal jurisdiction wherever he might be in the world however_ unsc resolution indicated that co operating states did not have the status of occupying powers_ and the armed conflict had ended by the time of mr azhar sabah jaloud death moreover_ even assuming the existence of an armed conflict in iraq at the time_ given the circumstances in which the incident had taken place_ which were unrelated to the conflict as such_ it would not be feasible to prosecute lieutenant under war crimes legislation under ordinary criminal law_ lieutenant would be entitled to claim self defence however_ even without conviction the netherlands state might be in position in which monetary compensation ex gratia was appropriate the court of appeal held hearing on march the applicant representative_ ms zegveld_ asked for certain investigative measures_ including the addition to the file of copies and_ where necessary_ translations of the rules of engagement and the pertinent instructions based thereon the iraqi autopsy report the statement by mr dawoud joad kathim to the iraqi police and the questioning of the iraqi interpreter mr madjied in connection with mr dawoud joad kathim allegation that the interpreter had told him to keep silent about the involvement of netherlands troops she also queried the finding that shots had been fired by iraqi personnel and argued that lieutenant actions had gone beyond legitimate self defense the court of appeal gave its decision on april it declined to order further investigative measures_ taking the view that the lapse of time since the incident had made any further such measures pointless it refused to order the prosecution of lieutenant its reasoning read_ inter alia_ as follows the legitimation for the functional use of force in the area in issue is laid down in the rules of engagement roe and the sfir instructions on the use of force_ revised version of july which are derived from that document counsel has asked the court of appeal in camera to make the roe available these_ however_ are not included in the file_ and neither the court of appeal nor the advocate general have them the test in the present case will be carried out under the sfir instructions on the use of force it is indicated in this instruction that the use of force is permitted_ inter alia_ in self defence and in defence of own troops and other persons designated by the mnd se commander on the subject of aimed fire_ it is mentioned in this instruction that aimed fire may be given if an sfir member himself own troops or persons under his protection are threatened with violence that may cause serious bodily harm or death and there are no other ways to prevent this examples given include cases in which person fires or aims his weapon at the person concerned_ own troops or persons under his protection and in which person deliberately drives car into the person concerned_ own troops or persons under his protection it appears from the file that lieutenant who was investigating traces relating to shooting incident that had taken place shortly before_ in which shots had been fired from car_ was confronted on the spot with car that ignored the vcp and came in his direction at high speed at that moment shots were fired lieutenant assumed that the shots were being fired from the car this assumption is entirely understandable_ in view of the fact that lieutenant was not required to expect that shots would be fired from own or friendly units the netherlands servicemen present_ or the members of the icdc present in his direction it makes no difference that counsel has argued that others present on the spot made different assessment of the situation after all_ lieutenant was in different position and did not observe the situation in the same way as the other group on the opposite side of the road_ which moreover was using an image intensifier nor does the fact that lieutenant fired at the moment when the car had passed make any difference_ given that shortly before the post had been fired at by vehicle distancing itself therefrom and lieutenant had_ as he has indicated_ to consider the fact that there were friendly troops on the other side of the road whom he did not wish to draw into his line of fire counsel has further suggested that lieutenant could have fired warning shot pursuant to the instructions on the use of force warning shot shall be fired only if the operational conditions admit of it and there is no need to do so for example if the person concerned or others in the direct vicinity are under armed attack in view of the above the court of appeal considers that lieutenant could reasonably have believe that he and his own troops were under fire and that_ on this assumption_ he acted within the limits of the applicable instructions on the use of force the court of appeal therefore finds that the public prosecutor rightly declined to bring prosecution weapons used in the incident diemaco the diemaco infantry rifle is the standard weapon issued to the netherlands military of canadian manufacture_ it is development of the better known american designed armalite ar colt rifle it is capable of automatic and semiautomatic fire the magazine issued to the netherlands armed forces as standard holds up to thirty rounds its rate of fire in automatic mode is rounds per minute like the ar the diemaco rifle fires the mm or nato cartridge the bullet yaws and frequently fragments when it hits body at high velocity_ causing severe damage to tissue kalashnikov ak the kalashnikov ak rifle was originally designed and manufactured in the soviet union but clones have been produced in many countries formerly the main weapon of warsaw pact infantry_ it and its clones are today issued to the military of many countries_ including local forces in iraq like the ak itself_ its ammunition_ the mm cartridge_ is produced in large quantities by many manufacturers the standard bullet has considerable penetrating power however_ when it hits body without passing right through_ it too can yaw and fragment_ producing much the same effects as the mm nato bullet the netherlands military presence in iraq general background from july until march netherlands troops participated in the stabilization force in iraq sfir in battalion strength they were stationed in the province of al muthanna as part of multinational division south east mnd se which was under the command of an officer of the armed forces of the united kingdom the participation of netherlands forces in mnd se was governed by memorandum of understanding between the united kingdom and the kingdom of the netherlands_ to which rules of engagement were appended both documents were classified confidential and remain so netherlands military personnel were issued with an aide mémoire drawn up by the netherlands chief of defence staff chef defensiestaf

background information this letter reads_ inter alia as requested by the british_ the netherlands units will be deployed in the south of iraq_ in the province of al muthanna this province comes within the responsibility of british division the operational line of command thus runs via british divisional headquarters and then via american headquarters in baghdad to american central command centcom which co ordinates military direction and mandate legal basisthe basis for sending netherlands troops to iraq is to be found in united nations security council resolution the government is of the opinion that the provisions of this resolution provide such basis the resolution is explicitly based on chapter vii of the united nations charter_ and in its first paragraph appeals to member states and organisations to assist the people of iraq in their efforts to reform their institutions and rebuild their country_ and to contribute to conditions of stability and security in iraq in accordance with this resolution more generally_ the penultimate operational paragraph of resolution calls upon member states and international and regional organisations to contribute to the implementation of this resolution the report of the security council meeting at which this resolution was adopted makes it clear that there was broad consensus as regards the starting point that this resolution provides basis for member states to send troops to iraq_ within the framework drawn by the resolution the resolution makes it clear in its preamble that there is distinction to be drawn between the united states and the united kingdom_ which are active in iraq in the capacity hoedanigheid of occupying powers_ and states which do not have that capacity this finding by the security council in resolution adopted under chapter vii of the united nations charter must be understood as an authoritative opinion as to the status of the participating states_ an opinion that is binding on the united nations member states paragraph of the resolution makes clear appeal calls upon to all the countries concerned including the countries that are not present as occupying powers to comply fully with their obligations under international law including in particular the geneva conventions of and the hague regulations of the netherlands will heed this call and influencethe stabilization force will consist of coalition of participating countries led by the united states and the united kingdom it is important that the other troop contributing countries should be sufficiently involved in the determination of the security force general political military policy and the exchange of information to that end_ the united kingdom will set up committee of contributors for the british sector_ which will enable close consultation between government analogous to the procedure which the british have set up for isaf the international security assistance force_ deployed in afghanistan and which

that the netherlands shall take over the roe of the lead nation in this case the united kingdom the netherlands can make changes to the instructions for the use of force based on domestic directives and considerations although the roe have not yet been finalised_ the government intends them to be robust_ which means among other things that there should be wide powers for force protection and the creation of safe and stable environment on this basis_ the government assumes that the roe will offer sufficient possibility for carrying out the tasks even in the face of hostilities or riots command

independence from the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia war ensued that was to continue until december by its resolution of february the security council of the united nations set up united nations protection force unprofor troop contributing nations included the netherlands_ which provided battalion of airmobile infantry this battalion_ known as dutchbat_ was deployed as peacekeeping force under united nations command in and around the town of srebrenica in eastern bosnia_ which was then held by the bosniac dominated government of the republic of bosnia and herzegovina on july bosnian serb forces attacked the srebrenica safe area in overwhelming force they overran the area and took control despite the presence of dutchbat_ which in the end was left in control only of compound in the village of potočari in the days that followed_ bosniac men who had fallen into the hands of the bosnian serb forces were separated from the women and children and killed it is now generally accepted as fact that upwards of perhaps as many as bosniac men and boys died at the hands of the bosnian serb forces and of serb paramilitary forces in what has come to be known as the srebrenica massacre civil cases have been brought in the netherlands courts against the netherlands state by surviving relatives of three men killed in the srebrenica massacre in july the plaintiffs in the first case mustafić the state of the netherlands are surviving kin of an electrician who was de facto employee of dutchbat but did not enjoy any status conferred to persons employed by the united nations directly they alleged that the netherlands state committed breach of contract in that the dutchbat deputy commander had refused to let him stay with his family in the compound at potočari_ as result of which he was made to leave the compound that same day_ whereas the dutchbat leadership ought to have protected him by keeping him inside and evacuating him with dutchbat itself in the alternative_ they alleged tort the plaintiff in the second case nuhanović the state of the netherlands was himself de facto employee of dutchbat_ for which he worked as an interpreter but also without the status of united nations employee he is the son of one man killed in the massacre and the brother of another he alleged tort in that the dutchbat deputy commander had turned the two men out of the compound on september the supreme court gave judgment in both cases ljn bz nuhanović_ and ljn bz mustafić as relevant to the case before the court_ these judgments_ which in their essential parts are identical_ read as follows excerpt from the nuhanović judgment_ translation by the supreme court itself part of the cassation appeal submits that in findings of law and of the interim judgment the court of appeal has failed to recognize that un troop contingent that has been established in accordance with chapter vii of the un charter and has been placed under the command and control of the united nations in this case unprofor_ of which dutchbat formed part is an organ of the united nations this means that attribution of the conduct of such troop contingent should be made by reference to article dario the international law commission draft articles on the responsibility of international organizations sixty third session of the international law commission_ un doc to appear in yearbook of the international law commission_ vol ii_ part two and not by reference to article dario according to this part of the appeal_ application of article dario means that dutchbat conduct should_ in principle_ always be attributed to the united nations it is apparent from the commentary of article dario that this attribution rule applies_ inter alia_ to the situation in which state places troops at the disposal of the united nations in the context of un peace mission_ and command and control is transferred to the united nations_ but the disciplinary powers and criminal jurisdiction the organic command remain vested in the seconding state it is implicit in the findings of the court of appeal that this situation occurs in the present case after all_ in finding of law of the interim judgment the court of appeal has held and this has not been disputed in the cassation appeal that it is not at issue that the netherlands_ as the troop contributing state_ retained control over the personnel affairs of the military personnel concerned_ who had remained in the service of the netherlands_ and retained the power to punish these military personnel under disciplinary and criminal law the submission in part of the cassation appeal that the court of appeal has failed to apply the attribution rule of article dario and has instead wrongly applied the attribution rule of article dario therefore fails part of the cassation appeal consists of series of submissions directed against findings of law of the interim judgment_ in which the court of appeal has defined the criterion of effective control in applying the attribution rule of article dario to the present case in so far as these grounds of appeal are based on the submission that international law excludes the possibility that conduct can be attributed both to an international organization and to state and that the court of appeal therefore wrongly proceeded on the assumption that there was possibility that both the united nations and the state had effective control over dutchbat disputed conduct_ they are based on an incorrect interpretation of the law as held above at international law_ in particular article dario in conjunction with article dario_ does not exclude the possibility of dual attribution of given conduct it follows that the court of appeal was able to leave open whether the united nations had effective control over dutchbat conduct in the early evening of july even if this was the case_ it does not necessarily mean that the united nations had exclusive responsibility in so far as it is submitted in these grounds of the cassation appeal that the court of appeal has applied an incorrect criterion in assessing whether the state had effective control over dutchbat at the moment of the disputed conduct_ they too are based on an incorrect interpretation of the law for the purpose of deciding whether the state had effective control it is not necessary for the state to have countermanded the command structure of the united nations by giving instructions to dutchbat or to have exercised operational command independently it is apparent from the commentary on article dario that the attribution of conduct to the seconding state or the international organization is based on the factual control over the specific conduct_ in which all factual circumstances and the special context of the case must be taken into account in the disputed findings of law the court of appeal has examined_ in the light of all circumstances and the special context of the case_ whether the state had factual control over dutchbat disputed conduct the court of appeal has not therefore interpreted or applied the law incorrectly it followed that the court of appeal judgment finding the netherlands state responsible for the deaths of the three men could stand other domestic documents evaluation report on the application of military criminal procedure in operations abroad this report_ dated august was drawn up by committee consisting of senior civil servant_ former chief advocate general to the arnhem court of appeal and judge it was commissioned by the minister of defence at the request of the lower house of parliament in the wake of the commotion caused by the eric case see above among the subjects discussed in this report is jurisdiction within the meaning of article of the convention on this point_ the report states the formal effect of the convention would appear limited to certain specific cases this does not alter the fact that the standards flowing from the convention are of general importance to netherlands military operations abroad in particular_ important basic standards arise from the convention which can apply to criminal investigations into the use of force that has caused death or wounding there follows an analysis of domestic case law on the substantive and procedural aspects of article in the light of the court case law the report makes mention of changes already introduced in prosecution policy and the way in which rules of engagement and other instructions are relayed to field commanders following the eric case it suggests further adjustments criticism of the lack of preparation of royal military constabulary personnel for police work in foreign theatres of operation is confirmed_ but by much has been invested in improving the quality of military policing and more is to be done in the months to come similarly_ the report states that the public prosecution service_ which is composed of civilian lawyers_ has on occasion been found lacking in situational awareness this has led to over hasty decisions to prosecute military personnel_ the eric case being cited as case in point however_ here also_ improvements are observed the shooting incident which led to the present application is mentioned among the real life cases studied by the committee_ but is not discussed in detail the report of the van den berg committee in response to allegations that iraqi citizens had been maltreated or even tortured by netherlands military personnel_ the minister of defence ordered an inquiry by an official committee this committee included former member of parliament its chairman_ dr van den berg_ from whom the committee takes its name serving member of parliament_ retired lieutenant general and retired rear admiral report of the committee findings was published in june it is stated that an earlier version of the report was read and commented on by two legal experts_ one of these being ms zegveld_ now the applicant representative the report mentions frictions within the royal military constabulary unit_ which is stated inter alia to have been inadequately trained for police type criminal investigations_ and tensions between the royal military constabulary unit and the royal marines battalions_ which were the first netherlands contingents to be sent to iraq preceding the royal army battalion stationed there at the time of the death of mr azhar sabah jaloud the report also states that the netherlands was not an occupying power and for that reason had made certain caveats among other things_ netherlands troops were not empowered to keep any persons interned or to prosecute crimes anyone arrested by netherlands troops had to be handed over to either the united kingdom military or to the iraqi authorities_ depending on the nature of the suspicion conversations with persons so arrested were permitted within the context of force protection the report addresses the question whether persons outside the kingdom of the netherlands in an area where netherlands troops are operating in an armed conflict can be said to be within netherlands jurisdiction it answers this question in the affirmative the minister of defence presented this report to the lower house of parliament on june with covering letter commenting on some of its findings but endorsing the conclusions the final evaluation report final evaluation report was published after the completed withdrawal of the last netherlands contingent it states that the netherlands government added number of caveats limitations to the tasks of the netherlands troops these caveats were that the netherlands would not assume any administrative duties and would not deploy executive law enforcement development activities they were inspired by the desire not to be considered de facto occupying power as to the choice of methods_ it is stated that initially the intention was not to lay any great stress on the military presence_ and to avoid as much as possible the use of patrols and checkpoints in practice_ however_ it turned out that security could best be provided by means of frequent patrols_ both by day and by night_ and by setting up vehicle checkpoints on routes potentially used by criminals or terrorists elsewhere the report states that there were number of incidents in which netherlands troops were fired at_ number of which had taken place at vehicle checkpoints in the cases where iraqis were wounded or killed_ no acts contravening the rules of engagement had been established it is mentioned that one iraqi wounded by netherlands fire spent several weeks in the netherlands for treatment relevant international law the hague regulations the definition of an occupying power_ and its duties as

legal consequences of the construction of wall in the occupied palestinian territory in legal consequences of the construction of wall in the occupied palestinian territory_ advisory opinion_ reports the international court of justice held as follows the court would observe that_ while the jurisdiction of states is primarily territorial_ it may sometimes be exercised outside the national territory considering the object and purpose of the international covenant on civil and political rights_ it would seem natural that_ even when such is the case_ states parties to the covenant should be bound to comply with its provisions the constant practice of the human rights committee is consistent with this thus_ the committee has found the covenant applicable where the state exercises its jurisdiction on foreign territory it has ruled on the legality of acts by uruguay in cases of arrests carried out by uruguayan agents in brazil or argentina case no lópez burgos uruguay case no lilian celiberti de casariego uruguay it decided to the same effect in the case of the confiscation of passport by uruguayan consulate in germany case no montero uruguay the travaux préparatoires of the covenant confirm the committee interpretation of article of that instrument these show that_ in adopting the wording chosen_ the drafters of the covenant did not intend to allow states to escape from their obligations when they exercise jurisdiction outside their national territory they only intended to prevent persons residing abroad from asserting_ vis vis their state of origin_ rights that do not fall within the competence of that state_ but of that of the state of residence see the discussion of the preliminary draft in the commission on human rights_ cn sr para and united nations_ official record_ of the general assembly_ tenth session_ annexes_ al part ii_ chap v_ para the court takes note in this connection of the position taken by israel_ in relation to the applicability of the covenant_ in its communications to the human rights committee_ and of the view of the committee in israel stated that_ when preparing its report to the committee_ it had had to face the question whether individuals resident in the occupied territories were indeed subject to israel jurisdiction for purposes of the application of the covenant ccpr sr para israel took the position that the covenant and similar instruments did not apply directly to the current situation in the occupied territories ibid para the committee_ in its concluding observations after examination of the report_ expressed concern at israel attitude and pointed to the long standing presence of israel in the occupied territories_ israel ambiguous attitude towards their future status_ as well as the exercise of effective jurisdiction by israeli security forces therein ccpr add para in in face of israel consistent position_ to the effect that the covenant does not apply beyond its own territory_ notably in the west bank and gaza the committee reached the following conclusion in the current circumstances_ the provisions of the covenant apply to the benefit of the population of the occupied territories_ for all conduct by the state party authorities or agents in those territories that affect the enjoyment of rights enshrined in the covenant and fall within the ambit of state responsibility of israel under the principles of public international law ccpr sr_ para in conclusion_ the court considers that the international covenant on civil and political rights is applicable in respect of acts done by state in the exercise of its jurisdiction outside its own territory armed activities on the territory of the congo democratic republic of the congo uganda in armed activities on the territory of the congo democratic republic of the congo uganda judgment_ reports the international court of justice held as follows the court observes that_ under customary international law_ as reflected in article of the hague regulations of territory is considered to be occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army_ and the occupation extends only to the territory where such authority has been established and can be exercised see legal consequences of the construction of wall in the occupied palestinian territory_ advisory opinion_ reports para and para in order to reach conclusion as to whether state_ the military forces of which are present on the territory of another state as result of an intervention_ is an occupying power in the meaning of the term as understood in the jus in bello_ the court must examine whether there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the said authority was in fact established and exercised by the intervening state in the areas in question in the present case the court will need to satisfy itself that the ugandan armed forces in the drc were not only stationed in particular locations but also that they had substituted their own authority for that of the congolese government in that event_ any justification given by uganda for its occupation would be of no relevance nor would it be relevant whether or not uganda had established structured military administration of the territory occupied and the court_ having concluded that uganda was an occupying power in ituri at the relevant time_ finds that uganda responsibility is engaged both for any acts of its military that violated its international obligations and for any lack of vigilance in preventing violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by other actors present in the occupied territory_ including rebel groups acting on their own account the court notes that uganda at all times has responsibility for all actions and omissions of its own military forces in the territory of the drc in breach of its obligations under the rules of international human rights law and international humanitarian law which are relevant and applicable in the specific situation and the court turns now to the question as to whether acts and omissions of the updf and its officers and soldiers are attributable to uganda the conduct of the updf as whole is clearly attributable to uganda_ being the conduct of state organ according to well established rule of international law_ which is of customary character_ the conduct of any organ of state must be regarded as an act of that state difference relating to immunity from legal process of special rapporteur of the commission on human rights_ advisory opinion_ reports para the conduct of individual soldiers and officers of the updf is to be considered as the conduct of state organ in the court view_ by virtue of the military status and function of ugandan soldiers in the drc_ their conduct is attributable to uganda the contention that the persons concerned did not act in the capacity of persons exercising governmental authority in the particular circumstances_ is therefore without merit it is furthermore irrelevant for the attribution of their conduct to uganda whether the updf personnel acted contrary to the instructions given or exceeded their authority according to well established rule of customary nature_ as reflected in article of the fourth hague convention respecting the laws and customs of war on land of as well as in article of protocol additional to the geneva conventions of party to an armed conflict shall be responsible for all acts by persons forming part of its armed forces application of the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide bosnia and herzegovina serbia and montenegro in application of the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide bosnia and herzegovina serbia and montenegro judgment_ reports the international court of justice held as follows this provision article of the international law commission articles on state responsibility must be understood in the light of the court jurisprudence on the subject_ particularly that of the judgment in the case concerning military and paramilitary activities in and against nicaragua nicaragua united states of america referred to above paragraph in that judgment the court_ as noted above_ after having rejected the argument that the contras were to be equated with organs of the united states because they were completely dependent on it_ added that the responsibility of the respondent could still arise if it were proved that it had itself directed or enforced the perpetration of the acts contrary to human rights and humanitarian law alleged by the applicant state reports para this led to the following significant conclusion for this conduct to give rise to legal responsibility of the united states_ it would in principle have to be proved that that state had effective control of the military or paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed ibid the test thus formulated differs in two respects from the test described above to determine whether person or entity may be equated with state organ even if not having that status under internal law first_ in this context it is not necessary to show that the persons who performed the acts alleged to have violated international law were in general in relationship of complete dependence on the respondent state it has to be proved that they acted in accordance with that state instructions or under its effective control it must however be shown that this effective control was exercised_ or that the state instructions were given_ in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred_ not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations and it must next be noted that the overall control test has the major drawback of broadening the scope of state responsibility well beyond the fundamental principle governing the law of international responsibility state is responsible only for its own conduct_ that is to say the conduct of persons acting_ on whatever basis_ on its behalf that is true of acts carried out by its official organs_ and also by persons or entities which are not formally recognized as official organs under internal law but which must nevertheless be equated with state organs because they are in relationship of complete dependence on the state apart from these cases_ state responsibility can be incurred for acts committed by persons or groups of persons neither state organs nor to be equated with such organs only if_ assuming those acts to be internationally wrongful_ they are attributable to it under the rule of customary international law reflected in article cited above article of the international law commission articles on state responsibility this is so where an organ of the state gave the instructions or provided the direction pursuant to which the perpetrators of the wrongful act acted or where it exercised effective control over the action during which the wrong was committed in this regard the overall control test is unsuitable_ for it stretches too far_ almost to breaking point_ the connection which must exist between the conduct of state organs and its international responsibility the international law commission articles on state responsibility articles on state responsibility with commentaries were adopted by the international law commission at its fifty third session_ in and submitted to the general assembly of the united nations as part of the international law commission report covering the work of that session the report appeared in the yearbook of the international law commission_ vol ii_ part two as relevant to the present case_ the articles and their commentaries adopted together with the articles themselves read as follows footnote references omitted article elements of an internationally wrongful act of state there is an internationally wrongful act of state when conduct consisting of an action or omission is attributable to the state under international law and constitutes breach of an international obligation of the state the commentary on this article includes the following for particular conduct to be characterized as an internationally wrongful act_ it must first be attributable to the state the state is real organized entity_ legal person with full authority to act under international law but to recognize this is not to deny the elementary fact that the state cannot act of itself an act of the state must involve some action or omission by human being or group states can act only by and through their agents and representatives the question is which persons should be considered as acting on behalf of the state_ what constitutes an act of the state for the purposes of state responsibility in speaking of attribution to the state what is meant is the state as subject of international law under many legal systems_ the state organs consist of different legal persons ministries or other legal entities which are regarded as having distinct rights and obligations for which they alone can be sued and are responsible for the purposes of the international law of state responsibility the position is different the state is treated as unity_ consistent with its recognition as single legal person in international law in this as in other respects the attribution of conduct to the state is necessarily normative operation what is crucial is that given event is sufficiently connected to conduct whether an act or omission which is attributable to the state under one or other of the rules set out in chapter ii the second condition for the existence of an internationally wrongful act of the state is that the conduct attributable to the state should constitute breach of an international obligation of that state in subparagraph the term attribution is used to denote the operation of attaching given action or omission to state in international practice and judicial decisions_ the term imputation is also used but the term attribution avoids any suggestion that the legal process of connecting conduct to the state is fiction_ or that the conduct in question is really that of someone else in subparagraph reference is made to the breach of an international obligation rather than rule or norm of international law what matters for these purposes is not simply the existence of rule but its application in the specific case to the responsible state the term obligation is commonly used in international judicial decisions and practice and in the literature to cover all the possibilities the reference to an obligation is limited to an obligation under international law_ matter further clarified in article article conduct of organs placed at the disposal of state by another state the conduct of an organ placed at the disposal of state by another state shall be considered an act of the former state under international law if the organ is acting in the exercise of elements of the governmental authority of the state at whose disposal it is placed the commentary on this article includes the following the words placed at the disposal of in article express the essential condition that must be met in order for the conduct of the organ to be regarded under international law as an act of the receiving and not of the sending state the notion of an organ placed at the disposal of the receiving state is specialized one_ implying that the organ is acting with the consent_ under the authority of and for the purposes of the receiving state not only must the organ be appointed to perform functions appertaining to the state at whose disposal it is placed_ but in performing the functions entrusted to it by the beneficiary state_ the organ must also act in conjunction with the machinery of that state and under its exclusive direction and control_ rather than on instructions from the sending state thus article is not concerned with ordinary situations of inter state cooperation or collaboration_ pursuant to treaty or otherwise examples of situations that could come within this limited notion of state organ placed at the disposal of another state might include section of the health service or some other unit placed under the orders of another country to assist in overcoming an epidemic or natural disaster_ or judges appointed in particular cases to act as judicial organs of another state on the other hand_ mere aid or assistance offered by organs of one state to another on the territory of the latter is not covered by article for example_ armed forces may be sent to assist another state in the exercise of the right of collective self defence or for other purposes where the forces in question remain under the authority of the sending state_ they exercise elements of the governmental authority of that state and not of the receiving state situations can also arise where the organ of one state acts on the joint instructions of its own and another state_ or there may be single entity which is joint organ of several states in these cases_ the conduct in question is attributable to both states under other articles of this chapter thus_ what is crucial for the purposes of article is the establishment of functional link between the organ in question and the structure or authority of the receiving state the notion of an organ placed at the disposal of another state excludes the case of state organs_ sent to another state for the purposes of the former state or even for shared purposes_ which retain their own autonomy and status for example_ cultural missions_ diplomatic or consular missions_ foreign relief or aid organizations also excluded from the ambit of article are situations in which functions of the beneficiary state are performed without its consent_ as when state placed in position of dependence_ territorial occupation or the like is compelled to allow the acts of its own organs to be set aside and replaced to greater or lesser extent by those of the other state there are two further criteria that must be met for article to apply first_ the organ in question must possess the status of an organ of the sending state and secondly its conduct must involve the exercise of elements of the governmental authority of the receiving state the first of these conditions excludes from the ambit of article the conduct of private entities or individuals which have never had the status of an organ of the sending state for example_ experts or advisers placed at the disposal of state under technical assistance programmes do not usually have the status of organs of the sending state the second condition is that the organ placed at the disposal of state by another state must be acting in the exercise of elements of the governmental authority of the receiving state there will only be an act attributable to the receiving state where the conduct of the loaned organ involves the exercise of the governmental authority of that state by comparison with the number of cases of cooperative action by states in fields such as mutual defence_ aid and development_ article covers only specific and limited notion of transferred responsibility yet_ in state practice the situation is not unknown article conduct directed or controlled by state the conduct of person or group of persons shall be considered an act of state under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of_ or under the direction or control of_ that state in carrying out the conduct the commentary on this article includes the following the attribution to the state of conduct in fact authorized by it is widely accepted in international jurisprudence in such cases it does not matter that the person or persons involved are private individuals nor whether their conduct involves governmental activity most commonly_ cases of this kind will arise where state organs supplement their own action by recruiting or instigating private persons or groups who act as auxiliaries while remaining outside the official structure of the state these include_ for example_ individuals or groups of private individuals who_ though not specifically commissioned by the state and not forming part of its police or armed forces_ are employed as auxiliaries or are sent as volunteers to neighbouring countries_ or who are instructed to carry out particular missions abroad and the appeals chamber of the international tribunal for the former yugoslavia has also addressed these issues in the tadić case_ the chamber stressed that the requirement of international law for the attribution to states of acts performed by private individuals is that the state exercises control over the individuals the degree of control may_ however_ vary according to the factual circumstances of each case the appeals chamber fails to see why in each and every circumstance international law should require high threshold for the test of control the appeals chamber held that the requisite degree of control by the yugoslavian authorities over these armed forces required by international law for considering the armed conflict to be international was overall control going beyond the mere financing and equipping of such forces and involving also participation in the planning and supervision of military operations in the course of their reasoning_ the majority considered it necessary to disapprove the icj approach in the military and paramilitary activities in and against nicaragua case but the legal issues and the factual situation in the tadić case were different from those facing the court in that case the tribunal mandate is directed to issues of individual criminal responsibility_ not state responsibility_ and the question in that case concerned not responsibility but the applicable rules of international humanitarian law in any event it is matter for appreciation in each case whether particular conduct was or was not carried out under the control of state_ to such an extent that the conduct controlled should be attributed to it documents relevant to the occupation of iraq coalition provisional authority order no coalition provisional authority order no entitled establishment of

defence of the kingdom of thailand_ the ministry of defence of ukraine and the minister of national defence of the republic of poland complaints the applicant alleged violations of article in its procedural aspect he complained that the investigation had been insufficiently independent_ for the following reasons the royal military constabulary unit in iraq had been under the sole command of the netherlands battalion commander there had been no presence of the public prosecution service since the members of the unit shared their living quarters with the regular troops_ the distance between them and the individuals they might be called upon to investigate had been insufficient the arnhem public prosecutor decision not to prosecute lieutenant had been based entirely on the reports of the royal military constabulary_ on which the public prosecutor had placed excessive reliance the military chamber of the arnhem court of appeal_ which included in its composition serving army officer who did not belong to the judiciary_ also placed full reliance on the results of the very limited investigations by the royal military constabulary the applicant also complained that the investigation had been insufficiently effective_ for the following reasons no statements had been taken from the icdc personnel who had witnessed the incident_ royal military constabulary investigator having decided that the information which they gave was of no pertinence the questioning of the key witness_ mr dawoud joad kathim_ the driver of the mercedes car_ had been extremely cursory his evidence was important because he was the only civilian witness available_ and thus the only witness without any hierarchical or otherwise functional link to lieutenant moreover_ his statement as recorded by the royal military constabulary investigators was inconsistent with the statement which he made later the same day to an iraqi official lieutenant had not been questioned for the first time until seven hours after the incident_ and had not been separated from the other witnesses during that period he would therefore have had ample opportunity to discuss the incident with the other witnesses beforehand and adapt his statement accordingly the day after the incident_ lieutenant stated that he had been able to obtain from the icdc deputy commander list of the names of icdc personnel who had fired their weapons and the corresponding number of rounds fired the fact that he_ as the prime suspect_ had been able to obtain this information from key witness also affected the effectiveness of the investigation furthermore_ the list obtained by lieutenant had not been added to the file_ despite its potential importance to the case the royal military constabulary had held the body of mr azhar sabah jaloud for some hours_ yet no autopsy was performed during that period the body was transferred to an iraqi civilian hospital_ where an autopsy was carried out in the absence of royal military constabulary officials the autopsy report_ such as it was_ was added to the file but not translated other forensic evidence had been treated in similarly careless fashion in particular_ no detailed translation had been made of the report concerning the bullet fragments taken from the body finally_ the applicant complained that mr azhar sabah jaloud next of kin had been insufficiently involved in the investigation and informed of its progress in particular_ no attempt had ever been made to contact mr azhar sabah jaloud family nor had anyone taken the trouble to inform them of the decision not to prosecute lieutenant
 CHIRAGOV AND OTHERS v. ARMENIA,the factsi the circumstances of the casea background at the time of the demise of the union of soviet socialist republics ussr the nagorno karabakh autonomous oblast nkao was an autonomous region oblast of the azerbaijan soviet socialist republic the azerbaijan ssr situated within the territory of the azerbaijan ssr_ it covered sq km there was at the time no common border between nagorno karabakh known as artsakh by its armenian name and the armenian soviet socialist republic the armenian ssr which were separated by azerbaijani territory_ the district of lachin being the shortest distance between them_ including strip of land often referred to as the lachin corridor less than km wide according to the ussr census of the nkao had population of consisting of ethnic armenians and ethnic azeris_ with russian and kurdish minorities the district of lachin had different demographic_ the vast majority of its population of some being kurds and azeris only were armenians in early demonstrations were held in stepanakert_ the regional capital of the nkao_ as well as in the armenian capital_ yerevan_ to demand the incorporation of nagorno karabakh into armenia on february the soviet of the nkao made request to the supreme soviets of the armenian ssr_ the azerbaijan ssr and the ussr that the nkao be allowed to secede from azerbaijan and join armenia the request was rejected by the supreme soviet of the ussr on march in june it was also rejected by the supreme soviet of azerbaijan_ whereas its counterpart in armenia voted in favour of unification throughout the demonstrations calling for unification continued the district of lachin was subjected to roadblocks and attacks the clashes led to many casualties_ and refugees_ numbering in the hundreds of thousands on both sides_ flowed between armenia and azerbaijan as consequence_ on january the ussr government placed the nkao under moscow direct rule however_ on november_ control of the region was returned to azerbaijan few days later_ on december_ the supreme soviet of the armenian ssr and the nagorno karabakh regional council adopted joint resolution on the reunification of nagorno karabakh with armenia as result of this resolution_ joint budget for the two entities was established in january and decision was taken to include nagorno karabakh in the armenian elections_ which were to take place in the spring of that year in early following an escalation of the conflict_ soviet troops arrived in baku and nagorno karabakh and the latter was placed under state of emergency violent clashes between armenians and azeris continued_ however_ with the occasional intervention by soviet forces on august azerbaijan declared independence from the soviet union this was subsequently formalised by the adoption of the constitutional act on the state independence of the republic of azerbaijan of october on september the soviet of the nkao announced the establishment of the republic of nagorno karabakh the nkr consisting of the territory of the nkao and the shahumyan district of azerbaijan_ and declared that it was no longer under azerbaijani jurisdiction on november the azerbaijani parliament abolished the autonomy previously enjoyed by nagorno karabakh in referendum organised in nagorno karabakh on december_ of those participating voted in favour of secession however_ the azeri population boycotted the referendum in the same month_ the soviet union was dissolved and soviet troops began to withdraw from the region military control of nagorno karabakh was rapidly being handed over to the karabakh armenians on january the nkr having regard to the results of the referendum_ reaffirmed its independence from azerbaijan in early the conflict gradually escalated into full scale war the ethnic armenians conquered several azeri villages_ resulting in at least several hundred deaths and the departure of the population the district of lachin_ in particular the town of lachin_ was attacked many times the applicants claimed that the attacks were made by troops of both nagorno karabakh and armenia the government maintained_ however_ that armenia did not participate in the events_ but that military action was carried out by the defence forces of nagorno karabakh and volunteer groups for almost eight months in the roads to lachin were under the control of forces of armenian ethnicity who manned and controlled checkpoints the town of lachin became completely isolated in mid may lachin was subjected to aerial bombardment_ during which many houses were destroyed on may realising that troops were advancing rapidly towards lachin_ villagers fled the following day the town of lachin was captured by forces of armenian ethnicity it appears that the town was looted and burnt in the days following the takeover according to information obtained by the government from the authorities of the nkr the city of lachin and the surrounding villages of aghbulag_ chirag and chiragli were completely destroyed during the military conflict in july the armenian parliament decreed that it would not sign any international agreement stipulating that nagorno karabakh remain part of azerbaijan according to human rights watch hrw report azerbaijan seven years of conflict in nagorno karabakh december the capture of the district of lachin resulted in approximately azeri displaced persons_ many of them of kurdish descent following the capture of lachin_ ethnic armenian forces continued to conquer four more azerbaijani districts surrounding nagorno karabakh kelbajar_ jebrayil_ gubadly and zangilan and substantial parts of two others agdam and fizuli on may ceasefire agreement_ known as the bishkek protocol the ceasefire agreement was signed by armenia_ azerbaijan and the nkr following russian mediation it came into force on may according to the above mentioned hrw report_ between and an estimated to azeris were forced out of nagorno karabakh_ armenia and the seven azerbaijani districts surrounding nagorno karabakh according to information from the armenian authorities_ armenian refugees from azerbaijan and internally displaced persons from regions in armenia bordering azerbaijan have been registered current situation according to the government_ the nkr controls sq km of the former nkao while it is debated how much of the two partly conquered districts is occupied by the nkr it appears that the occupied territory of the seven surrounding districts in total amounts to some sq km estimates of today population of nagorno karabakh vary between and people_ of whom are of armenian ethnicity virtually no azerbaijanis remain the district of lachin has population of between and armenians no political settlement of the conflict has so far been reached the self proclaimed independence of the nkr has not been recognised by any state or international organisation recurring breaches of the ceasefire agreement along the borders have led to the loss of many lives and the rhetoric of officials remains hostile moreover_ according to international reports_ tension has heightened in recent years and military expenditure in armenia and azerbaijan has increased significantly several proposals for peaceful solution of the conflict have failed negotiations have been carried out under the auspices of the organization for security and co operation in europe osce and its so called minsk group in madrid in november the group three co chairs france_ russia and the united states of america presented to armenia and azerbaijan set of basic principles for settlement the basic principles_ which have since been updated_ call_ inter alia_ for the return of the territories surrounding nagorno karabakh to azerbaijani control an interim status for nagorno karabakh providing guarantees for security and self governance corridor linking armenia to nagorno karabakh future determination of the final legal status of nagorno karabakh through legally binding referendum the right of all internally displaced persons and refugees to return to their former places of residence and international security guarantees that would include peacekeeping operation the idea is that the endorsement of these principles by armenia and azerbaijan would enable the drafting of comprehensive and detailed settlement following intensive shuttle diplomacy by minsk group diplomats and number of meetings between the presidents of the two countries in the process lost momentum in so far the parties to the conflict have not signed formal agreement on the basic principles on march the minsk group presented report of the osce minsk group co chairs field assessment mission to the occupied territories of azerbaijan surrounding nagorno karabakh the executive summary of which reads as follows the osce minsk group co chairs conducted field assessment mission to the seven occupied territories of azerbaijan surrounding nagorno karabakh nk from october to assess the overall situation there_ including humanitarian and other aspects the co chairs were joined by the personal representative of the osce chairman in office and his team_ which provided logistical support_ and by two experts from the unhcr and one member of the osce fact finding mission this was the first mission by the international community to the territories since and the first visit by un personnel in years in travelling more than kilometers throughout the territories_ the co chairs saw stark evidence of the disastrous consequences of the nagorno karabakh conflict and the failure to reach peaceful settlement towns and villages that existed before the conflict are abandoned and almost entirely in ruins while no reliable figures exist_ the overall population is roughly estimated as persons_ living in small settlements and in the towns of lachin and kelbajar the co chairs assess that there has been no significant growth in the population since the settlers_ for the most part ethnic armenians who were relocated to the territories from elsewhere in azerbaijan_ live in precarious conditions_ with poor infrastructure_ little economic activity_ and limited access to public services many lack identity documents for administrative purposes_ the seven territories_ the former nk oblast_ and other areas have been incorporated into eight new districts the harsh reality of the situation in the territories has reinforced the view of the co chairs that the status quo is unacceptable_ and that only peaceful_ negotiated settlement can bring the prospect of better_ more certain future to the people who used to live in the territories and those who live there now the co chairs urge the leaders of all the parties to avoid any activities in the territories and other disputed areas that would prejudice final settlement or change the character of these areas they also recommend that measures be taken to preserve cemeteries and places of worship in the territories and to clarify the status of settlers who lack identity documents the co chairs intend to undertake further missions to other areas affected by the nk conflict_ and to include in such missions experts from relevant international agencies that would be involved in implementing peace settlement on june the presidents of the co chair countries of the minsk group issued joint statement on the nagorno karabakh conflict we_ the presidents of the osce minsk group co chair countries france_ the russian federation_ and the united states of america remain committed to helping the parties to the nagorno karabakh conflict reach lasting and peaceful settlement we express our deep regret that_ rather than trying to find solution based upon mutual interests_ the parties have continued to seek one sided advantage in the negotiation process we continue to firmly believe that the elements outlined in the statements of our countries over the last four years must be the foundation of any fair and lasting settlement to the nagorno karabakh conflict these elements should be seen as an integrated whole_ as any attempt to select some elements over others would make it impossible to achieve balanced solution we reiterate that only negotiated settlement can lead to peace_ stability_ and reconciliation_ opening opportunities for regional development and cooperation the use of military force that has already created the current situation of confrontation and instability will not resolve the conflict renewal of hostilities would be disastrous for the population of the region_ resulting in loss of life_ more destruction_ additional refugees_ and enormous financial costs we strongly urge the leaders of all the sides to recommit to the helsinki principles_ particularly those relating to the non use of force or the threat of force_ territorial integrity_ and equal rights and self determination of peoples we also appeal to them to refrain from any actions or rhetoric that could raise tension in the region and lead to escalation of the conflict the leaders should prepare their people for peace_ not war our countries stand ready to assist the sides_ but the responsibility for putting an end to the nagorno karabakh conflict remains with them we strongly believe that further delay in reaching balanced agreement on the framework for comprehensive peace is unacceptable_ and urge the leaders of azerbaijan and armenia to focus with renewed energy on the issues that remain unresolved the applicants and the property allegedly owned by them in the district of lachin the applicants have stated that they are azerbaijani kurds who lived in the district of lachin_ where their ancestors had lived for

the present resolution_ and the acceptance by this party of the proposals of the minsk group of the osce resolution october res the security council_ expressing its serious concern that continuation of the conflict in and around the nagorny karabakh region of the azerbaijani republic_ and of the tensions between the republic of armenia and the azerbaijani republic_ would endanger peace and security in the region_ calls for the immediate implementation of the reciprocal and urgent steps provided for in the osce minsk group adjusted timetable including the withdrawal of forces from

azerbaijani republic in accordance with the adjusted timetable of urgent steps to implement security council resolutions and as amended by the osce minsk group meeting in vienna of to november the above mentioned hrw report of december see paragraph contains accounts of the nagorno karabakh conflict while stating that karabakh armenian military offensive in may june captured large part of lachin province it goes on to summarise the events in and as follows karabakh armenian troops often with the support of forces from the republic of armenia captured the remaining azerbaijani provinces surrounding nagorno karabakh and forced out the azeri civilian population the rest of lachin province_ and kelbajar_ agdam_ fizuli_ jebrayil_ qubatli_ and zangelan provinces the hrw report presents several pieces of information which point to an involvement of the armenian army in nagorno karabakh and the surrounding territories see chapter vii the republic of armenia as party to the conflict allegedly_ armenia had even sent members of its police force to perform police duties in the occupied territories hrw spent two days in april interviewing armenian uniformed soldiers on the streets of yerevan of them were draftees in the armenian army who had either fought in karabakh_ had orders to go to karabakh or had ostensibly volunteered for service there moreover_ on single day in april hrw researchers had counted five buses holding an estimated soldiers of the armenian army entering nagorno karabakh from armenia other western journalists had reported to hrw researchers that they had seen eight more buses full of armenian army soldiers heading for azerbaijani territory from armenia according to hrw_ as matter of law_ armenian army troop involvement in azerbaijan made armenia party to the conflict and made the war an international armed conflict between armenia and azerbaijan several proposals for solution to the conflict have been presented within the minsk group package deal proposal of july set out_ under the heading agreement the end of armed hostilities two stage process of the withdrawal of armed forces the second stage included the provision that he armed forces of armenia would be withdrawn to within the borders of the republic of armenia the step by step approach presented in december also contained two stage withdrawal process and stipulated_ as part of the second phase_ that ll armenian forces located outside the borders of the republic of armenia would be withdrawn to locations within those borders substantially the same wording was used in the common state deal proposal of november while these documents were discussed in minsk group negotiations_ none of them led to an agreement between armenia and azerbaijan the applicants referred to statements by various political leaders and observers for instance_ mr robert kocharyan_ then prime minister of the nkr stated in an interview with the armenian newspaper golos armenii in february that armenia supplied anti aircraft weapons to nagorno karabakh moreover_ mr vazgen manukyan_ armenian minister of defence from to admitted in an interview with british journalist and writer_ thomas de waal_ in october that the public declarations stating that the armenian army had not taken any part in the war had been purely for foreign consumption you can be sure that whatever we said politically_ the karabakh armenians and the armenian army were united in military actions it was not important for me if someone was karabakhi or an armenian the annual report of the international institute for strategic studies iiss the military balance for the years and assessed that_ of the troops in nagorno karabakh_ were personnel from armenia the report stated_ inter alia_ that since armenia has controlled most of nagorno karabakh_ and also seven adjacent regions of azerbaijan_ often called the occupied territories mr david atkinson_ rapporteur of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe pace stated in november in his second report to the political affairs committee on the conflict over the nagorno karabakh region dealt with by the osce minsk conference concerning nagorno karabakh doc november as follows according to the information given to me_ armenians from armenia had participated in the armed fighting over the nagorno karabakh region besides local armenians from within azerbaijan today_ armenia has soldiers stationed in the nagorno karabakh region and the surrounding districts_ people in the region have passports of armenia_ and the armenian government transfers large budgetary resources to this area based on this report_ the parliamentary assembly adopted on january resolution on the conflict over the nagorno karabakh region dealt with by the osce minsk conference in which it noted_ inter alia_ as follows the parliamentary assembly regrets that_ more than decade after the armed hostilities started_ the conflict over the nagorno karabakh region remains unsolved hundreds of thousands of people are still displaced and live in miserable conditions considerable parts of the territory of azerbaijan are still occupied by armenian forces_ and separatist forces are still in control of the nagorno karabakh region the assembly expresses its concern that the military action_ and the widespread ethnic hostilities which preceded it_ led to large scale ethnic expulsion and the creation of mono ethnic areas which resemble the terrible concept of ethnic cleansing the assembly reaffirms that independence and secession of regional territory from state may only be achieved through lawful and peaceful process based on the democratic support of the inhabitants of such territory and not in the wake of an armed conflict leading to ethnic expulsion and the de facto annexation of such territory to another state the assembly reiterates that the occupation of foreign territory by member state constitutes grave violation of that state obligations as member of the council of europe and reaffirms the right of displaced persons from the area of conflict to return to their homes safely and with dignity in its report nagorno karabakh viewing the conflict from the ground of september the international crisis group icg stated the following regarding the armed forces in the nkr pp nagorno karabakh may be the world most militarized society the highly trained and equipped nagorno karabakh defence army is primarily ground force_ for which armenia provides much of the backbone nagorno karabakh official told crisis group it has some soldiers_ while an independent expert military analyst richard giragosian_ july estimated an additional to reservists allegedly could be mobilised based on its population_ nagorno karabakh cannot sustain such large force without relying on substantial numbers of outsiders according to an independent assessment by mr giragosian there are karabakh armenians in the army and from armenia nevertheless_ many conscripts and contracted soldiers from armenia continue to serve in nagorno karabakh the de facto minister of defence admits his forces have per cent military contract personnel_ including citizens of armenia he claims that no armenian citizens are unwillingly conscripted and says armenians of nagorno karabakh descent live in armenia_ some of whom serve in the nagorno karabakh forces former conscripts from yerevan and other towns in armenia have told crisis group they were seemingly arbitrarily sent to nagorno karabakh and the occupied districts immediately after presenting themselves to the recruitment bureau they deny that they ever volunteered to go to nagorno karabakh or the adjacent occupied territory they were not paid bonus for serving outside armenia_ and they performed military service in nagorno karabakh uniform_ under nagorno karabakh military command young armenian recruits opposition to serving in nagorno karabakh has increased_ which may help explain an apparent decrease in the numbers being sent to nagorno karabakh there is high degree of integration between the forces of armenia and nagorno karabakh senior armenian authorities admit they give substantial equipment and weaponry nagorno karabakh authorities also acknowledge that armenian officers assist with training and in providing specialised skills however_ armenia insists that none of its army units are in nagorno karabakh or the occupied territories around it the government objected to the report of the icg_ which organisation had no office in armenia or the nkr furthermore_ the statement on the number of armenian servicemen in the nkr derived from an email with mr giragosian_ who had been contacted by the government and had given the following declaration when expressed this opinion didn mean that the people serving in the nagorno karabakh armed forces are soldiers meant that approximately that number of volunteers are involved in the nagorno karabakh armed forces from armenia and other states according to my calculations as for the number mentioned_ can insist that it correct as it is confidential information and nobody has the exact number the reasoning behind my opinion was that believe that many armenians from different parts of the world participate in the nagorno karabakh self defence forces on april the austrian newspaper der standard published an interview with the then armenian foreign minister_ mr vartan oskanian on the subject of the disputed territories_ mr oskanian reportedly referred to them as the territories_ which are now controlled by armenia few days later the armenian embassy in austria issued press release stating that mr oskanian had been misinterpreted and that the correct expression was the territories_ which are now controlled by armenians on march the un general assembly adopted resolution on the situation in the occupied territories of azerbaijan res recalling the security council resolutions see paragraph above it contains the following passages the general assembly_ demands the immediate_ complete and unconditional withdrawal of all armenian forces from all occupied territories of the republic of azerbaijan reaffirms the inalienable right of the population expelled from the occupied territories of the republic of azerbaijan to return to their homes_ and stresses the necessity of creating appropriate conditions for this return_ including the comprehensive rehabilitation of the conflict affected territories in an interview with armenia today_ published on october mr jirayr sefilyan_ lebanese born armenian military commander and political figure who was involved in the capture of the town of shusha shushi in early may and later continued to serve in the armed forces of both the nkr and armenia_ reportedly made the following statement we must turn the page of history_ as starting from we have considered karabakh as an independent state and declared that they should conduct negotiations who are we kidding the whole world knows that the army of the nkr is part of the armenian armed forces_ that the budget of the nkr is financed from the budget of armenia_ and that the political leaders of the nkr are appointed from yerevan it is time to consider karabakh as part of armenia_ one of its regions in the negotiation process the territory of karabakh should be considered as territory of armenia and no territorial cession must be made in resolution ini of may on the need for an eu strategy for the south caucasus_ the european parliament expressed_ inter alia_ the following the european parliament_ is seriously concerned that hundreds of thousands of refugees and idps who fled their homes during or in connection with the nagorno karabakh war remain displaced and denied their rights_ including the right to return_ property rights and the right to personal security calls on all parties to unambiguously and unconditionally recognise these rights_ the need for their prompt realisation and for prompt solution to this problem that respects the principles of international law demands_ in this regard_ the withdrawal of armenian forces from all occupied territories of azerbaijan_ accompanied by deployment of international forces to be organised with respect of the un charter in order to provide the necessary security guarantees in period of transition_ which will ensure the security of the population of nagorno karabakh and allow the displaced persons to return to their homes and further conflicts caused by homelessness to be prevented calls on the armenian and azerbaijani authorities and leaders of relevant communities to demonstrate their commitment to the creation of peaceful inter ethnic relations through practical preparations for the return of displaced persons considers that the situation of the idps and refugees should be dealt with according to international standards_ including with regard to the recent pace recommendation europe forgotten people protecting the human rights of long term displaced persons on april the european parliament passed resolution ini containing the european parliament recommendations to the council_ the commission and the european external action service on the negotiations of the eu armenia association agreement which_ inter alia_ noted that deeply concerning reports exist of illegal activities exercised by armenian troops on the occupied azerbaijani territories_ namely regular military manoeuvres_ renewal of military hardware and personnel and the deepening of defensive echelons the european parliament recommended that negotiations on the eu armenia association agreement be linked to commitments regarding the withdrawal of armenian forces from occupied territories surrounding nagorno karabakh and their return to azerbaijani control and call ed on armenia to stop sending regular army conscripts to serve in nagorno karabakh the applicants

the legislative_ executive and judiciary branches of the armenian ministry of defence the speech he gave at the meeting was published the same day on the official website of the president of the

whose spirit was felt all over armenia in some places more than in the others in those days_ every family had close or distant relative in the armenian army and the army was in everyone heart that feeling became stronger when our army attained victory which was so important_ which was vital the ultimate goal of our foreign policy is the final legal formulation of the victory achieved in the aggressive war unleashed by azerbaijan against artsakh the republic of nagorno karabakh must be recognized by the international community since there is no logical explanation as to why the people_ who have exercised their legal right for self determination and later protected it in the uneven war_ should ever be part of azerbaijan why the destiny of these people should be defined by the illegal decision once made by stalin armenia and artsakh do not want war however everyone must know that we will give fitting rebuff to any challenge the people of artsakh will never face the danger of physical extermination again the republic of armenia will guarantee against that security of artsakh is not matter of prestige for us it is matter of life and death in the most direct sense of these words the entire world must know and realize that we_ the power structures of armenia and artsakh stand against the army which pays wages to the murderers_ if that horde can be called army in the first place in an opinion drawn up at the request of the government_ dr hari bucur marcu_ military expert of romanian nationality_ stated that he had found nothing in the armenian military policy that envisaged any form of control over nkr forces or any indication on the ground that armenian forces were present or active in the nkr he further concluded that there was no evidence that armenia

dependent on external financial support_ primarily from armenia but also from the and the world wide diaspora it cannot collect sufficient revenue to meet its budgetary needs_ and in absolute terms is receiving increasing external support the budget totalled billion drams some million locally collected revenues are expected to total billion drams about million per cent of expenditures since nagorno karabakh has benefited from an armenian inter state loan according to the armenian prime minister_ this will be billion drams million in significant increase from when it was billion drams million

political settlement of the conflict has so far been reached the self proclaimed independence of the nkr has not been recognised by any state or international organisation recurring breaches of the ceasefire agreement along the borders have led to the loss of many lives and the rhetoric of officials remains hostile moreover_ according to international reports_ tension has heightened in recent years and military expenditure in armenia and azerbaijan has increased significantly several proposals for peaceful solution of the conflict have failed negotiations have been carried out under the auspices of the organization for security and co operation in europe osce and its so called minsk group in madrid in november the group three co chairs france_ russia and the united states of america presented to armenia and azerbaijan set of basic principles for settlement the basic principles_ which have since been updated_ call_ inter alia_ for the return of the territories surrounding nagorno karabakh to azerbaijani control an interim status for nagorno karabakh providing guarantees for security and self governance corridor linking armenia to nagorno karabakh future determination of the final legal status of nagorno karabakh through legally binding referendum the right of all idps and refugees to return to their former places of residence and international security guarantees that would include peacekeeping operation the idea is that the endorsement of these principles by armenia and azerbaijan would enable the drafting of comprehensive and detailed settlement following intensive shuttle diplomacy by minsk group diplomats and number of meetings between the presidents of the two countries in the process lost momentum in so far the parties to the conflict have not signed formal agreement on the basic principles on march the minsk group presented report of the osce minsk group co chairs field assessment mission to the occupied territories of azerbaijan surrounding nagorno karabakh the executive summary of which reads as follows the osce minsk group co chairs conducted field assessment mission to the seven occupied territories of azerbaijan surrounding nagorno karabakh nk from october to assess the overall situation there_ including humanitarian and other aspects the co chairs were joined by the personal representative of the osce chairman in office and his team_ which provided logistical support_ and by two experts from the unhcr and one member of the osce fact finding mission this was the first mission by the international community to the territories since and the first visit by un personnel in years in traveling more than kilometers throughout the territories_ the co chairs saw stark evidence of the disastrous consequences of the nagorno karabakh conflict and the failure to reach peaceful settlement towns and villages that existed before the conflict are abandoned and almost entirely in ruins while no reliable figures exist_ the overall population is roughly estimated as persons_ living in small settlements and in the towns of lachin and kelbajar the co chairs assess that there has been no significant growth in the population since the settlers_ for the most part ethnic armenians who were relocated to the territories from elsewhere in azerbaijan_ live in precarious conditions_ with poor infrastructure_ little economic activity_ and limited access to public services many lack identity documents for administrative purposes_ the seven territories_ the former nk oblast_ and other areas have been incorporated into eight new districts the harsh reality of the situation in the territories has reinforced the view of the co chairs that the status quo is unacceptable_ and that only peaceful_ negotiated settlement can bring the prospect of better_ more certain future to the people who used to live in the territories and those who live there now the co chairs urge the leaders of all the parties to avoid any activities in the territories and other disputed areas that would prejudice final settlement or change the character of these areas they also recommend that measures be taken to preserve cemeteries and places of worship in the territories and to clarify the status of settlers who lack identity documents the co chairs intend to undertake further missions to other areas affected by the nk conflict_ and to include in such missions experts from relevant international agencies that would be involved in implementing peace settlement on june the presidents of the co chair countries of the minsk group issued joint statement on the nagorno karabakh conflict we_ the presidents of the osce minsk group co chair countries france_ the russian federation_ and the united states of america remain committed to helping the parties to the nagorno karabakh conflict reach lasting and peaceful settlement we express our deep regret that_ rather than trying to find solution based upon mutual interests_ the parties have continued to seek one sided advantage in the negotiation process we continue to firmly believe that the elements outlined in the statements of our countries over the last four years must be the foundation of any fair and lasting settlement to the nagorno karabakh conflict these elements should be seen as an integrated whole_ as any attempt to select some elements over others would make it impossible to achieve balanced solution we reiterate that only negotiated settlement can lead to peace_ stability_ and reconciliation_ opening opportunities for regional development and cooperation the use of military force that has already created the current situation of confrontation and instability will not resolve the conflict renewal of hostilities would be disastrous for the population of the region_ resulting in loss of life_ more destruction_ additional refugees_ and enormous financial costs we strongly urge the leaders of all the sides to recommit to the helsinki principles_ particularly those relating to the non use of force or the threat of force_ territorial integrity_ and equal rights and self determination of peoples we also appeal to them to refrain from any actions or rhetoric that could raise tension in the region and lead to escalation of the conflict the leaders should prepare their people for peace_ not war our countries stand ready to assist the sides_ but the responsibility for putting an end to the nagorno karabakh conflict remains with them we strongly believe that further delay in reaching balanced agreement on the framework for comprehensive peace is unacceptable_ and urge the leaders of azerbaijan and armenia to focus with renewed energy on the issues that remain unresolved the applicant and

redress for their dispossession this is particularly important where the affected persons are socially vulnerable or belong to minority groups ensure that the absence from their accommodation of holders of occupancy and tenancy rights who have been forced to abandon their homes shall be deemed justified until the conditions that allow for voluntary return in safety and dignity have been restored provide rapid_ accessible and effective procedures for claiming redress where displacement and dispossession have taken place in systematic manner_ special adjudicatory bodies should be set

tiraspol while he was in hospital in chișinău on the same day the applicant was officially recognised as victim however_ on july the bender prosecutor office refused his request to be provided with

moldova set aside the decision of july on the grounds that the applicant had been unlawfully arrested and convicted and had had his property taken away from him he ordered the bender prosecutor office to provide witness protection to the applicant and his family the parties did not inform the court of any further developments in this regard information concerning alleged russian support for the mrt the applicant submitted reports from various mrt media outlets according to an article dated april from regnum_ one of the leading russian online news agencies at the relevant time_ the russian ambassador to moldova had given speech in tiraspol the previous day in which he declared that russia would continue its support for the mrt and would never give up its interests there the diplomat added that russia has been here for more than century our ancestors remains are buried here major part of our history is situated here on april the same news agency informed the public of decision by the russian ministry of finance to give the mrt usd million in non reimbursable aid_ as well as usd million in loans secured on mrt property in news report dated november the regnum news agency reported statement by the mrt president to the effect that each mrt ministry was working on harmonising the legislation of the mrt with that of russia_ and that group of representatives of mrt ministries was to travel to moscow within the next few days to discuss the matter according to the moldovan government_ the last and non significant withdrawal of armaments from the mrt to russia took place on march almost twenty thousand tonnes of ammunition and military equipment are purportedly still stored on the territory controlled by the mrt on january russian and ukrainian officials were able to visit the colbasna arms depot_ while moldovan officials were neither informed of nor invited to participate in the visit in february the russian ambassador to moldova declared_ inter alia_ in public speeches that since when moldova had refused to sign settlement agreement with the mrt the so called kozak memorandum russia had no longer been able to withdraw arms from the mrt owing to the latter resistance according to the moldovan government_ tiraspol airport_ which was officially closed down by the russian authorities on december continues to serve mrt military and civilian

and non governmental organisationsa the united nations the relevant parts of the report of the special rapporteur on torture and other cruel_ inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment_ manfred nowak_ concerning his visit to the republic of moldova from to july un human rights council_ february un doc hrc add read as follows transnistrian region of the republic of moldova the special rapporteur also received information that in the transnistrian region of the republic of moldova transfers of prisoners are conducted by the police prisoners are packed on top of each other in metal wagon with only one tiny window in the summer the heat in the wagon becomes unbearable after few minutes but they have to stay inside for hours different categories of prisoners are mixed during these transports adults_ minors_ sick_ including those with open tuberculosis which puts the prisoners at risk of contamination with diseases according to several of his interlocutors_ including detainees_ progress has been made with improving conditions in the penitentiary system_ functioning heating_ food quality improved_ hiv treatment in prisons commenced in september however_ complaints about the poor quality and sometimes lack of food were common the special rapporteur also received reports that international programmes are often not extended into the transnistrian region of the republic of moldova_ which means less out reach in terms of health care and problems in particular with regard to tuberculosis treatment and higher percentage of persons sick with tuberculosis and hiv the special rapporteur is concerned that many human rights violations flow from the legislation in force_ which_ for instance_ requires solitary confinement for persons sentenced to capital punishment and to life imprisonment and which prescribes draconic restrictions on contacts with the outside world conditions in custody of the militia headquarters in tiraspol were clearly in violation of minimum international standards the special rapporteur considers that detention in the overcrowded cells with few sleeping facilities_ almost no daylight and ventilation_ hours artificial light_ restricted access to food and very poor sanitary facilities amounts to inhuman treatment the relevant parts of the report on human rights in the transnistrian region of the republic of moldova by un senior expert thomas hammarberg_ february read as follows the de facto authorities in transnistria have pledged unilaterally to respect some of the key international treaties_ including the two un covenants on human rights_ the european convention on human rights and the convention on the rights of the child the changes of the role of the prosecutor and the creation of the investigation committee would have an impact on the functioning of the judiciary as well if correctly implemented_ it would be clear that the prosecutor would not have an oversight or supervisory role in relation to the functioning of the courts the expert was confronted with many and fairly consistent complaints against the functioning of the justice system one was that the accusations in number of cases were fabricated that procedures were used to intimidate persons that the defence lawyers were passive that people with money or contacts had an upper hand compared to ordinary people and that witnesses changed their statements because of threats or bribery and that such tendencies sabotaged the proceedings it is very difficult for an outsider to assess the basis for such accusations but some factors made the expert reluctant to ignore them they were strikingly frequent and even alluded to by few high level actors in the system competent_ non corrupt and independent judiciary is huge challenge in any system however_ it is an indispensable human right to have access to independent and impartial tribunals the transnistrian constitution states that judges cannot be members of political parties or take part in political activities it is as important that the judiciary avoids close relationships with big business or organized partisan interests the procedures for the recruitment of judges should be impartial and reward professional skills and high moral standards corrupt behaviour and other breaches of trust should be investigated and punished through credible and competent disciplinary mechanism reasonable salary level will also counter temptations of accepting bribes the judge has crucial role in protecting the principle of equality of arms the expert heard complaints that the defence in general was disadvantaged in comparison with the prosecution such perceptions undermine the credibility of the system and the sense of justice in general the prestige of judges in society will of course depend largely on their competence_ their knowledge of the laws and the case law as well as familiarity with problems in society update training is one way of meeting this need special training is needed for those judges involved in juvenile justice matters the united nations adopted set of basic principles on the independence of the judiciary_ which were unanimously endorsed by the general assembly in these principles_ representing universally accepted views on this matter by the un member states_ set out parameters to ensure independence and impartiality of the judges_ condition of service and tenure_ freedoms of expression and association and modalities for qualification_ selection and trainings office of the un high commissioner for human rights and the international bar association have jointly developed extensive guidance material on human rights in the administration of justice_ which might also be used for the training of legal professionals working in the transnistrian region the expert considers that an evaluation ought to be undertaken on the present situation with regard to minors in detention_ including_ inter alia_ their length of stay_ their individual background as well as efforts to assist their reintegration in society such survey could serve as background to review of the whole approach to juvenile crime the expert feels that there is an acute need to develop preventive programmes and alternatives to institutional punishment the expert was informed that there were_ as of october inmates in these institutions_ of whom were convicted and held on remand this means that there are approximately prisoners per every persons_ one of the highest figures in europe the number had gone down during from an even higher figure as consequence of releases through reduction of sentences and pardons granted to considerable number of prisoners furthermore_ the code of criminal procedure was amended in the autumn in order to reduce the number of persons kept on remand during investigations another amendment opened for alternatives to imprisonment_ such as fines or controlled_ non penitentiary community work_ for the less serious crimes detention on remandwhen the expert visited the remand facility in prison no in tiraspol_ there were detainees kept there some were under investigation before trial others had been charged and were defendants at court proceedings still others had appealed sentence in the first instance none of these three categories had an unconditional right to receive visitors the reason given was that visits might disturb the investigations however_ relatives may on request get permission from the investigator or the judge to pay visit_ though not in private the expert talked with inmates who had been kept on remand longer than months one woman who had appealed an original sentence had been detained for four years her two small children had been taken to children home and she had not been able to see them for the entire period of her detention the expert was told that the total detention period before and during trial could be as long as seven years penitentiary facilities in tiraspol and glinnoethe expert visited the colony in tiraspol prison no in may and the one in glinnoe prison no in september the former had at the time inmates_ of whom were under strict special regime the average sentence was years_ the expert was told terms of years are being served for murder_ repeat offences and trafficking crimes in glinnoe_ the expert was told that there were convicted prisoners the number had gone down as consequence of the recent revision of the criminal code the expert was told that the average sentence was years though many prisoners had sentences of between and years the possibility of visits by relatives was limited in tiraspol no the basic rule was to allow visits four times year_ two short and two longer phone calls were allowed for minutes once month with supervision except for discussions with the lawyer both visits and phone calls could be reduced as method of disciplinary sanction such measures were taken in cases of infringements such as possessing alcohol or having mobile telephone disciplinary measures could also include solitary confinement of up to days health situation in prisonshealth service in the penitentiary institutions is also under the authority of the transnistrian ministry of justice doctors and nurses there are seen as part of the prison staff the resources are limited and the expert found the health situation_ in particular in the glinnoe prison_ to be alarming and the care services substandard there is limited communication with the civilian health system which results in low coverage with testing and treatment few human resources and limited capacities of existing medical personnel create barriers to enjoying access to quality medical services in penitentiaries the standard of health care in the glinnoe prison appeared to the expert to be especially bad on all accounts_ including on record keeping and preventive measures such as diet control there_ the complaints about the quality of the food were particularly bitter pp european committee for the prevention of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment cpt in the report on its visit to moldova between and july cpt inf the cpt stated that_ following the refusal of the mrt authorities to allow members of the committee to meet in private with detainees_ the cpt had decided to call off its visit because limitation of this kind ran counter to the fundamental characteristics of the prevention mechanism enshrined in its mandate the relevant parts of the report of the cpt on its visit to moldova between and november cpt inf read as follows at the outset of the visit_ the authorities of the transnistrian region provided the delegation with detailed information on the five penitentiary establishments currently in service in the region in the time available_ the delegation was not in position to make thorough examination of the whole of the penitentiary system however_ it was able to make an assessment of the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty in prison no at glinoe_ colony no at tiraspol_ and the sizo pre trial section of colony no again at tiraspol as the authorities are certainly already aware_ the situation in the establishments visited by the delegation leaves great deal to be desired_ in particular in prison no the cpt will examine various specific areas of concern in subsequent sections of this report however_ at the outset_ the committee wishes to highlight what is perhaps the principal obstacle to progress_ namely the high number of persons who are imprisoned and the resultant overcrowding according to the information provided by the authorities_ there are approximately prisoners in the region penitentiary establishments an incarceration rate of some persons per of the population the number of inmates in the three establishments visited was within or_ in the case of prison no just slightly over their official capacities nevertheless_ the delegation found that in fact the establishments were severely overcrowded the situation was at its most serious in prison no the cells for pre trial prisoners offered rarely more and sometimes less than m² of living space per prisoner_ and the number of prisoners often exceeded the number of beds these deplorable conditions were frequently made worse by poor ventilation_ insufficient access to natural light and inadequate sanitary facilities similar_ albeit slightly better_ conditions were also observed in the sizo section of colony no and in certain parts of colony no for example_ block an incarceration rate of the magnitude which presently prevails in the transnistrian region cannot be convincingly explained away by high crime rate the general outlook of members of the law enforcement agencies_ prosecutors and judges must_ in part_ be responsible for the situation at the same time_ it is unrealistic from an economic standpoint to offer decent conditions of detention to such vast numbers of prisoners to attempt to solve the problem by building more penitentiary establishments would be ruinous exercise the cpt has already stressed the need to review current law and practice relating to custody pending trial more generally_ the committee recommends that an overall strategy be developed for combating prison overcrowding and reducing the size of the prison population in this context_ the authorities will find useful guidance in the principles and measures set out in recommendation no of the committee of ministers of the council of europe_ concerning prison overcrowding and prison population inflation the cpt recognises that in periods of economic difficulties_ sacrifices may have to be made_ including in penitentiary establishments however_ regardless of the difficulties faced at any given time_ the act of depriving person of his liberty always entails duty to ensure that that person has access to certain basic necessities those basic necessities include appropriate medication compliance with this duty by public authorities is all the more imperative when it is question of medication required to treat life threatening disease such as tuberculosis at the end of the visit_ the cpt delegation requested the authorities to take steps without delay to ensure that all penitentiary establishments are supplied on regular basis with medicines of various types and_ in particular_ with suitable range of anti tuberculosis drugs the cpt wishes to be informed of the action taken in response to that request official health care staffing levels in the penitentiary establishments visited were rather low and_ at the time of the visit_ this situation was exacerbated by the fact that certain posts were vacant or staff members on long term leave had not been replaced this was particularly the case at prison no and colony no the cpt recommends that the authorities strive to fill as soon as possible all vacant posts in the health care services of those two establishments and to replace staff members who are on leave the health care services of all three penitentiary establishments visited had very few medicines at their disposal_ and their facilities were modestly equipped the question of the supply of medicines has already been addressed cf paragraph as regards the level of equipment_ the cpt appreciates that the existing situation is reflection of the difficulties facing the region it would be unrealistic to expect significant improvements at the present time however_ it should be possible to maintain all existing equipment in working order in this context_ the delegation noted that all the radiography machines in the establishments visited were out of use the cpt recommends that this deficiency be remedied on more positive note_ the cpt was very interested to learn of the authorities plans for new prison hospital_ with region wide vocation_ at malaieşti this is most welcome development the committee would like to receive further details concerning the implementation of those plans the cpt has already highlighted the poor material conditions of detention which prevailed in the establishments visited and has made recommendations designed to address the fundamental problem of overcrowding cf paragraphs and in addition to overcrowding_ the cpt is very concerned by the practice of covering cell windows this practice appeared to be systematic vis vis remand prisoners_ and was also observed in cells accommodating certain categories of sentenced prisoners the committee recognises that specific security measures designed to prevent the risk of collusion and or criminal activities may well be required in respect of certain prisoners however_ the imposition of such security measures should be the exception rather than the rule further_ even when specific security measures are required_ such measures should never involve depriving the prisoners concerned of natural light and fresh air the latter are basic elements of life which every prisoner is entitled to enjoy moreover_ the absence of these elements generates conditions favourable to the spread of diseases and in particular tuberculosis it is also inadmissible for cells to accommodate more prisoners than the number of beds available_ thereby compelling prisoners to sleep in shifts consequently_ the cpt recommends that the authorities set the following as short term objectives all prisoner accommodation to have access to natural light and adequate ventilation ii every prisoner_ whether sentenced or on remand_ to have his her own bed further_ as measures to tackle overcrowding begin to take effect_ the existing standards concerning living space per prisoner should be revised upwards the cpt recommends that the authorities set_ as medium term objective_ meeting the standard of m² of floor space per prisoner as the delegation pointed out at the end of its visit_ material conditions of detention were particularly bad at prison no in glinoe the cpt appreciates that under the present circumstances_ the authorities have no choice but to keep this establishment in service however_ the premises of prison no belong to previous age they should cease to be used for penitentiary purposes at the earliest opportunity organization for security and co operation in europe osce in its annual report for

 F.G. v. SWEDEN,the factsi the circumstances of the case the applicant was born in and lives in sweden he entered sweden on november and applied for political asylum on february counsel appointed the applicant made written submissions to the migration board in which he developed the grounds for the applicant request for political asylum on march the migration board held an oral interview with the applicant in the presence of his counsel and an interpreter the applicant handed over declaration of march from pastor in sweden certifying that the applicant had been member of his congregation since december and had been baptised the migration board official therefore started the interview by asking about that matter the applicant replied that it was private matter in his heart adding it has nothing to do with this but if you want to ask questions you may all problems in my home country are caused by islam entering iran the migration board official explained that the reason he was asking questions about it was that he had interpreted the certificate as though the applicant had relied on his conversion as ground for asylum the applicant stated no_ it is not something want to rely on it is something private the migration board official then suggested break in the interview in order for the applicant and his counsel to confer after ten minute break_ counsel stated the applicant wants to underline that he has not changed religion in order to enhance his chances of obtaining residence permit but out of personal conviction when asked when he had converted_ the applicant replied that this had happened after he had arrived in the swedish town of x_ where there were not many iranians he had got to know person who went to church four times week this person knew that the applicant hated islam the applicant continued do not regard christianity as religion when asked why that was so_ the applicant replied if regarded as religion_ it would be like islam_ but christianity is about kind of love you have for god he explained that he had been going to the congregation gatherings two to four times per week and that he read the bible the applicant gave examples of miracles and prophecies from the bible which had attracted him to christianity the migration board official asked why_ if the applicant did not wish to rely on his conversion as ground for asylum_ he had nevertheless handed in the certificate from the pastor_ to which the applicant replied don know never asked for it and had not even considered handing it in_ but you wanted it they gave all converts certificate like that the rest of the interview dealt with the applicant political past the applicant explained that in iran he had worked with persons connected to different universities who were known to oppose the regime he had mainly worked on creating and publishing web pages he and one of the other persons had been arrested in april he had been released after twenty four hours and then hospitalised for ten days due to high blood pressure before the elections on june the applicant had worked with the green movement_ who had supported mousavi for the presidential position_ by spreading their message via the internet the day before the elections_ he and his friends had been arrested_ questioned and detained in the polling station overnight after the elections_ the applicant had participated in demonstrations and other activities he had been arrested once again in september and imprisoned for twenty days he had been ill treated in prison in october he had been taken before the revolutionary court_ which had released him after day on condition that he cooperate with the authorities and spy on his friends he had agreed to the demands and given his business premises as guarantee he had also assured them that he would not participate in any demonstrations and that he would respond to their summons following his release in park_ he had found out that his business premises had been searched he had kept politically sensitive material there_ which the authorities must have noticed_ and his passport and other documents were missing subsequently_ the applicant was summoned to appear on november before the revolutionary court he had contacted friend who_ in turn_ had obtained the help of smuggler to enable him to leave the country the applicant submitted summons from the revolutionary court dated october stating that he should present himself at evin prison in teheran on november the interview before the migration board lasted approximately two hours and the record was subsequently sent to the applicant and his counsel for comment counsel commented that the applicant had not read the certificate from the congregation pastor before the interview as it had not been translated and that the applicant intended to submit the formal baptism certificate on april the migration board rejected the applicant request for asylum by way of introduction_ it stated that_ while the applicant had not proven his identity or citizenship_ he had established the probability thereof as regards the request for political asylum_ the migration board held that participation in demonstrations or affiliation with the green movement could not_ of itself_ give rise to risk of persecution_ ill treatment or punishment on his return to iran the migration board noted that the applicant had changed his story in some parts during the proceedings_ and in particular he had changed his statements concerning the number of times he had been arrested furthermore_ he had not been able to name the park where he had been released in october thus_ the migration board found reason to question whether he had been arrested at all the migration board further considered that the applicant political activities had been limited after the questioning in and until the elections in he had been able to continue working on the web pages that contained the critical material_ even though_ according to the applicant_ the authorities were already at that time aware of his activities for these reasons_ the migration board found that the applicant activities or the material he had in his possession could not have been of interest to the authorities as to the applicant conversion to christianity_ the migration board noted that the conversion and baptism had not taken place in the church of sweden and that the applicant had not handed in any proof of his baptism the certificate from the congregation pastor could be regarded only as plea to the migration board that the applicant should be granted asylum the applicant had not initially wished to invoke his conversion as ground for asylum and had stated that his new faith was private matter pursuing his faith in private was not found to be plausible reason for believing that he would risk persecution upon return in conclusion_ the migration board found that the applicant had not shown that he was in need of protection in sweden the applicant appealed to the migration court maintaining his claims and relying on both political and religious grounds for asylum as regards the latter he handed in baptism certificate dated january he reacted against the decision of the migration board_ which in his view implied that conversion within free church was of less relevance than if it had been within the church of sweden he explained that the reason he had not initially wished to rely on his conversion was that he did not want to trivialise the seriousness of his beliefs on february the migration court held an oral hearing in the presence of the applicant_ his counsel_ an interpreter and representative of the migration board the migration court did not question the fact that the applicant_ at the time_ professed the christian faith_ but found that this_ by itself_ was not enough to consider him in need of protection it referred to the united kingdom home office operational guidance note of january the applicant stated that he did not wish to rely on his conversion as reason for asylum as he considered it something personal he added that it would_ however_ obviously cause him problems upon return in respect of his political past he explained_ inter alia_ that he had had contact with the student movement and quite lot of students and had helped them with their home pages his computer had been taken from his business premises while he was in prison material that was critical of the regime was stored on his computer while he had not personally criticised the regime_ or president ahmadinejad_ or the highest leaders_ the applicant had visited some websites and had received cartoons via email therefore_ in his view_ there was enough evidence to prove that he was an opponent of the system it was much the same as the material he had had on his computer in the summons to appear before the revolutionary court on november was also submitted to the migration court the applicant explained that the summons had been served at his home and that his sister had brought it to him he had left the summons with friend when he left iran subsequently_ the said friend had sent it to another friend_ who was going to ukraine_ and who had made sure that the summons was sent to the applicant in sweden he had not been summoned again and his family had not been targeted something might have happened_ though_ that he was not aware of and that his family did not wish to burden him with on march the migration court rejected the appeal it observed that the applicant was no longer relying on his religious views as ground for persecution and it did not refer further to this issue in its conclusions the migration court found that the applicant story in support of his request for political asylum had been coherent and trustworthy on the most essential points it found that the uncertainties that had been pointed out by the migration board had been satisfactorily explained however_ as regards the summons to appear before the revolutionary court_ the migration court found_ regardless of the authenticity of the document_ that it could not by itself substantiate need for protection the migration court pointed out in this respect that the document was merely summons and that no reason had been given as to why the applicant should present himself at evin prison moreover_ the information concerning the applicant political activities had generally been vague and lacking in detail the applicant had only stated that he had participated in the campaign for the opposition before the elections in by joining demonstrations and having contact with the student movement and students in order to help them with their web pages furthermore_ the applicant had stated that the material he had had in his possession when he was questioned in had not differed from the material he had in these circumstances_ together with the fact that he had not been summoned again to appear before the revolutionary court after november and that his family had not been targeted_ made the migration court doubt that his political activities had been of such nature and extent as to have resulted in the consequences alleged the migration court found that the applicant had exaggerated the importance of his political activities and their consequences and therefore also the authorities interest in him for these reasons_ it considered that the applicant had not proved that the iranian authorities had special interest in him and that therefore he was in need of protection on march and april the applicant requested leave to appeal to the migration court of appeal he maintained his need for political asylum he also alleged that before the migration court he had relied on his conversion he submitted that the latter issue had been sensitive for him_ that he had considered it private matter and had not wanted to tarnish the seriousness of his belief this was why he_ in response to direct question by the migration court_ had stated that he was no longer relying on his conversion as ground for asylum after the oral hearing before the migration court he had become member of another christian congregation and had taken part in an initiation ceremony broadcast on the internet his fear that his conversion had become known to the iranian authorities had therefore increased he enclosed letter of april from his new congregation which supported his explanation in particular it stated that the applicant had converted shortly after his arrival in sweden_ that he had shown with honest intent and interest that he was willing to learn more about christianity_ and that he took part in church services_ prayer meetings and social activities it also stated that he became member of the congregation in february and that his christian beliefs were no longer private as the services he attended were broadcast on the internet on june the migration court of appeal refused the applicant request for leave to appeal the removal order thus became enforceable on july the applicant requested the migration board to stay the enforcement of his expulsion and to reconsider its previous decision in the light of new circumstances he stated_ inter alia_ that the act of conversion from islam to another religion was taboo and punishable by death in iran the applicant submitted the above mentioned letter of april from his new congregation on september the migration board refused to re examine the applicant request for asylum based on his conversion the migration board noted that_ in the original asylum proceedings_ the applicant had stated that he had been baptised and had converted to christianity he had also stated that his conversion was personal matter which he did not wish to rely on as ground for asylum the migration board found it noteworthy that the applicant now raised the question of conversion_ when he had been given the chance to elaborate on it during the oral hearing before the migration court but had declined to do so it thus concluded that the applicant conversion could not be regarded as new circumstance_ which was precondition for the migration board to re examine the request the applicant appealed against the decision to the migration court_ maintaining his claims he submitted that since he had not previously relied on his conversion_ it should be regarded as new circumstance on october the migration court rejected the appeal it observed that the authorities had already been aware of the applicant conversion in the original proceeding leading to the decision to expel him therefore_ the conversion could not be considered as new circumstance the fact that the applicant had previously chosen not to rely on his conversion as ground for asylum did not change the court assessment in this regard the applicant request for leave to appeal was refused by the migration court of appeal on november

granted under chapter section of the aliens act_ the migration board may instead decide to re examine the matter such re examination is to be carried out where it may be assumed_ on the basis of new circumstances invoked by the alien_ that there are lasting impediments to enforcement of the nature referred to in chapter sections and of the aliens act_ and that these circumstances could not have been invoked previously_ or the alien shows that he or she has valid excuse for not doing so should the applicable conditions not be met_ the migration board will decide not to grant re examination see chapter section of the aliens act under the aliens act_ matters concerning the right of aliens to enter and remain in sweden are dealt with by three bodies the migration board_ the migration court

proceedings concerning asylum and residence permits an appeal against negative decision by the board has suspensive effect and the alien may accordingly not be expelled while the proceedings are pending on november the swedish migration court of appeal delivered judgment mig ruling on the assessment of the risk of persecution in cases of sur place conversion it held that_ when assessing whether an alien had plausibly demonstrated that his or her conversion from one religion to another was genuine in the sense that it was based on genuine personal religious conviction_ an individual assessment should be made in accordance with the the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr handbook on procedures and criteria for determining refugee status under the convention and the protocol relating to the status of refugees and the unhcr guidelines on international protection regarding religion based refugee claims an overall assessment should be made based on the circumstances in which the conversion took place and whether the claimant could be expected to live as convert upon returning to his or her home country furthermore_ in the case of individuals who had converted after leaving their country of origin conversion sur place the credibility issue required particular attention in case where conversion was invoked shortly after the decision to expel the claimant became final and non appealable_ particular attention should be paid to the credibility of the statements made concerning the conversion complainant whose conversion was not deemed to have been based on genuine conviction had not plausibly demonstrated that_ upon returning to his or her country of origin_ he or she had the intention of living there as convert and consequently attracting the interest of the authorities or individuals on november the director general for legal affairs at the swedish migration board issued general legal position concerning religion as ground for asylum_ including conversion rättsligt angående religion som asylskäl inklusive konvertering_ rci it was based on the above mentioned judgment by the migration court of appeal mig the unhcr guidelines and the judgment of the court of justice of the european union cjeu of september in bundesrepublik deutschland and and eu see paragraph below according to the legal position_ the credibility of conversion must be carefully assessed in order to determine whether genuine conversion has taken place person whose conversion is not based on genuine conviction will most likely not practise his or her new religion upon returning to his or her country of origin furthermore_ if the complainant is not credible_ an assessment must be made of whether adherence to the new religion is attributed to the individual upon return to his or her country of origin in this assessment it is relevant to consider whether the conversion may have or will come to the attention of the authorities or any other actor which could constitute threat finally_ person who has undergone genuine change in his or her faith or who risks being attributed new religious belief and who therefore risks persecution should not be compelled to hide his or her faith solely in order to avoid persecution on june the director general for legal affairs at the swedish migration board issued general legal position concerning the methodology for assessing the reliability and credibility of applications for international protection rättsligt angående metod för prövningen av och trovärdighet_ rci which was based on_ inter alia_ the assessment by the unhcr in its report beyond proof credibility assessment in eu asylum systems of may it sets out that it is the duty of the applicant to submit all relevant elements needed to substantiate his or her application for international protection_ and that the initial burden of proof rests on the applicant however_ responsibility for the assessment of an application for international protection lies jointly with the applicant and the examining authority furthermore_ it also follows from the legal position that the evidence in an asylum case consists not only of the applicant statements but also of supporting evidence_ such as documents_ testimony and country information iii relevant european union law and case law of the court of justice of the european union council directive ec of april on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need

sole or main purpose of creating the necessary conditions for applying for international protection_ so as to assess whether these activities will expose the applicant to persecution or serious harm if returned to that country whether the applicant could reasonably be expected to avail himself of the protection of another country where he could assert citizenship the fact that an applicant has already been subject to persecution or serious harm or to direct threats of such persecution or such harm_ is serious indication of the applicant well founded fear of persecution or real risk of

activities which have been engaged in by the applicant since he left the country of origin_ in particular where it is established that the activities relied upon constitute the expression and continuation of convictions or orientations held in the country of origin without prejudice to the geneva convention_ member states may determine that an applicant who files subsequent application shall normally not be granted refugee status if the risk of persecution is based on circumstances which the applicant has created by his own decision since leaving the country of origin article acts of persecution acts of persecution within the meaning of article of the geneva convention must be sufficiently serious by their nature or repetition as to constitute severe violation of basic human rights_ in particular the rights from which derogation cannot be made under article of the european convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms or be an accumulation of

chapter iii procedures at first instance section iiarticle inadmissible applications in addition to cases in which an application is not examined in accordance with regulation ec no member states are not required to examine whether the applicant qualifies as refugee in accordance with directive ec where an application is considered inadmissible pursuant to this article member states may consider an application for asylum as inadmissible pursuant to this article if the applicant has lodged an identical application after final decision section ivarticle subsequent application where person who has applied for asylum in member state makes further representations or subsequent application in the same member state_ that member state may examine these further representations or the elements of the subsequent application in the framework of the examination of the previous application or in the framework of the examination of the decision under review or appeal_ insofar as the competent authorities can take into account and consider all the elements underlying the further representations or subsequent application within this framework moreover_ member states may apply specific

effective remedy member states shall ensure that applicants for asylum have the right to an effective remedy before court or tribunal_ against the following decision taken on their application for asylum_ including decision to consider an application inadmissible pursuant to article on september the grand chamber of the cjeu delivered its judgment in bundesrepublik deutschland and cited above it concerned two asylum seekers from pakistan_ who claimed that they had been ill treated because of their membership of the muslim ahmadiyya community_ an islamic reformist movement_ and for that reason had been forced to leave their country of origin the german authorities had found that and were deeply committed to their faith and that their life had been actively shaped by it in pakistan they continued to practise their religion in germany and considered that the public practise of their faith was essential in order for them to preserve their religious identity the references for preliminary ruling concerned the interpretation of articles and of the qualification directive the german federal administrative court had asked the cjeu three questions first_ it asked to what extent an infringement of freedom of religion_ and in particular the right of the individual to live his faith openly and fully_ was likely to be an act of persecution within the meaning of article of the qualification directive next_ the national court asked the cjeu whether the concept of an act of persecution was to be restricted to infringements affecting only what was referred to as core area of freedom of religion finally_ it asked the cjeu whether refugee fear of persecution was well founded within the meaning of article of the qualification directive where the refugee intended_ on his return to his country of origin_ to perform religious acts which would expose him to danger to his life_ his freedom or his integrity or whether it was_ on the contrary_ reasonable to expect that person to give up the practice of such acts in its conclusion the cjeu held as follows articles of council directive ec of april on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted must be interpreted as meaning that not all interference with the right to freedom of religion which infringes article of the charter of fundamental rights of the european union is capable of constituting an act of persecution within the meaning of that provision of the directive there may be an act of persecution as result of interference with the external manifestation of that freedom_ and for the purpose of determining whether interference with the right to freedom of religion which infringes article of the charter of fundamental rights of the european union may constitute an act of persecution the competent authorities must ascertain_ in the light of the personal circumstances of the person concerned_ whether that person_ as result of exercising that freedom in his country of origin_ runs genuine risk of_ inter alia_ being prosecuted or subject to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment by one of the actors referred to in article of directive article of directive must be interpreted as meaning that the applicant fear of being persecuted is well founded if_ in the light of the applicant personal circumstances_ the competent authorities consider that it may reasonably be thought that_ upon his return to his country of origin_ he will engage in religious practices which will expose him to real risk of persecution in assessing an application for refugee status on an individual basis_ those authorities cannot reasonably expect the applicant to abstain from those religious practices on december the grand chamber of the cjeu delivered its judgment in and others van veiligheid en justitie and eu it concerned third country nationals who had lodged an application for asylum in the netherlands because they feared persecution in their respective countries of origin on account_ in particular_ of their homosexuality the dutch council of state raad van state requested preliminary ruling concerning the interpretation of article of the qualification directive as to whether eu law limited the actions of member states when assessing requests for asylum made by an applicant who feared persecution in his country of origin on grounds of sexual orientation in its conclusion_ the cjeu held as follows article of directive ec of april on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted and article of directive ec of december on minimum standards on procedures in member states for granting and withdrawing refugee status_ must be interpreted as precluding_ in the context of the assessment by the competent national authorities_ acting under the supervision of the courts_ of the facts and circumstances concerning the declared sexual orientation of an applicant for asylum_ whose application is based on fear of persecution on grounds of that sexual orientation_ the statements of that applicant and the documentary and other evidence submitted in support of his application being subject to an assessment by those authorities_ founded on questions based only on stereotyped notions concerning homosexuals article of directive read in the light of article of the charter of fundamental rights of the european union_ must be interpreted as precluding_ in the context of that assessment_ the competent national authorities from carrying out detailed questioning as to the sexual practices of an applicant for asylum article of directive read in the light of article of the charter of fundamental rights of the european union_ must be interpreted as precluding_ in the context of that assessment_ the acceptance by those authorities of evidence such as the performance by the applicant for asylum concerned of homosexual acts_ his submission to tests with view to establishing his homosexuality or_ yet_ the production by him of films of such acts article of directive and article of directive must be interpreted as precluding_ in the context of that assessment_ the competent national authorities from finding that the statements of the applicant for asylum lack credibility merely because the applicant did not rely on his declared sexual orientation on the first occasion he was given to set out the ground for persecution iv relevant unhcr guidelines and other material on april the unhcr issued guidelines on international protection regarding religion based refugee claims_ which under the heading_ substantive analysis_ defining religion stated_ inter alia the following establishing sincerity of belief_ identity and or certain way of life may not necessarily be relevant in every case it may not be necessary_ for instance_ for an individual or group to declare that he or she belongs to religion_ is of particular religious faith_ or adheres to religious practices_ where the persecutor imputes or attributes this religion_ faith or practice to the individual or group as is discussed further below in paragraph it may also not be necessary for the claimant to know or understand anything about the religion_ if he or she has been identified by others as belonging to that group and fears persecution as result an individual or group may be persecuted on the basis of religion_ even if the individual or other members of the group adamantly deny that their belief_ identity and or way of life constitute religion according to the guidelines_ religious belief_ identity or way of life is considered as so fundamental to human identity that one should not be compelled to hide_ change or renounce it in order to avoid persecution restrictions on the freedom to manifest one religion or belief are permitted if these limits are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety_ order_ health_ or morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others even though discrimination for reasons of religion is prohibited under international human rights law_ all discrimination does not necessarily rise to the level required for recognition of refugee status furthermore_ where individuals convert after their departure from the country of origin_ this may have the effect of creating sur place claim in such situations_ particular credibility concerns tend to arise and rigorous and in depth examination of the circumstances and genuineness of the conversion will be necessary issues which need to be assessed include the nature of and connection between any religious convictions held in the country of origin and those now held_ any disaffection with the religion held in the country of origin_ for instance_ because of its position on gender issues or sexual orientation_ how the claimant came to know about the new religion in the country of asylum_ his or her experience of this religion_ his or her mental state and the existence of corroborating evidence regarding involvement in and membership of the new religion so called self serving activities do not create well founded fear of persecution on convention ground in the claimant country of origin if the opportunistic nature of such activities will be apparent to all_ including the authorities there_ and serious adverse consequences would not result if the person were returned the unhcr has also published handbook on procedures and criteria for determining refugee status under the convention and the protocol relating to the status of refugees paragraph of the handbook states as follows it is for the examiner_ when investigating the facts of the case_ to ascertain the reason or reasons for the persecution feared and to decide whether the definition in the convention is met with in this respect it is evident that the reasons for persecution under these various headings will frequently overlap usually there will be more than one element combined in one person_ political opponent who belongs to religious or national group_ or both_ and the combination of such reasons in his person may be relevant in evaluating his well founded fear of relevance also is the unhcr report beyond proof credibility assessment in eu asylum systems of may relevant us supreme court judgments the us supreme court judgments_ united states steeger us and welsh united states us concerned conscientious objectors and the test of religious belief provided by the us supreme court under of the universal military training and service act in the former judgment_ the supreme court ruled that the test of religious belief under is whether it is sincere and meaningful belief occupying in the life of its possessor place parallel to that filled by the god of those admittedly qualified for the exemption thus conscientious objector status was not reserved to individuals of traditional religious background in the latter judgment_ the supreme court found that although mr welsh denied any religious foundation for his beliefs_ whereas mr seeger had characterised his pacifist beliefs as religious mr welsh conviction was nevertheless valid more specifically it stated_ among other things_ the court made it clear in steeger that these sincere and meaningful beliefs that prompt the registrant objection to all wars need not be confined in either source or content to traditional or parochial concepts of religion it held that does not distinguish between externally and internally derived beliefs_ id at and also held that intensely personal convictions which some might find or incorrect come within the meaning of religious belief in the act id at what is necessary under seeger for registrant conscientious objection to all war to be religious within the meaning of is that this opposition to war stem from the registrant moral_ ethical_ or religious beliefs about what is right and wrong and that these beliefs be held with the strength of traditional religious convictions most of the great religions of today and of the past have embodied the idea of supreme being or supreme reality god who communicates to man in some way consciousness of what is right and should be done_ of what is wrong and therefore should be shunned if an individual deeply and sincerely holds beliefs that are purely ethical or moral in source and content_ but that nevertheless impose upon him duty of conscience to refrain from participating in any war at any time_ those beliefs certainly occupy in the life of that individual place parallel to that filled by god in traditionally religious persons because his beliefs function as religion in his life_ such an individual is as much entitled to religious conscientious objector exemption under as is someone who derives his conscientious opposition to war from traditional religious convictions vi background material relevant to the applicant asylum claim on political grounds the relevant background material includes the united kingdom home office iran_ country of origin information coi report of september describing_ among other things_ the history and recent developments chapters and summonses chapter and the green movement chapter of interest also is the un special rapporteur report on the situation of human rights in the islamic republic of iran of march and the united kingdom foreign and commonwealth office report_ iran_ country of concern of april just after the elections in iran on june the political affairs committee of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe adopted on october declaration in which it considered the violent reactions of the iranian authorities to peaceful protests to be serious breach of iranian citizens human rights it also called upon governments of other countries not to expel iranian citizens to iran furthermore_ the us department of state human rights report on iran_ in section freedom of speech and press internet freedom april noted the following the government monitored internet communications_ especially via social networking websites such as facebook_ twitter and youtube_ and collected individuals personally identifiable information in connection with peaceful expression of views the government threatened_ harassed and arrested individuals who posted comments critical of the government on the internet the united kingdom home office operational guidance note on iran_ dated november stated the following there is real risk that high profile activists and political opponents who have come to the attention of the authorities would on return to iran face real risk of persecution and should be granted asylum for reason of his or her political opinion vii background material relevant to the applicant asylum claim based on his conversion the danish immigration service update on the situation for christian converts in iran june stated_ inter alia_ as follows charges used against christian converts over timeaccording to an international organization in turkey_ although apostasy does not figure in the iranian criminal code_ there have in the past been cases where judges have made apostasy rulings basing these decisions on the knowledge of the judge and incorporating islamic law reference was made to the case of pastor soodmand who_ in was executed upon being charged with apostasy it was added that in another pastor_ pastor mehdi dibaj_ was charged with apostasy_ released and found killed in forest since there have been no reports of converts from islam to christianity having been sentenced to the death penalty for apostasy in iran the latest case where convert has been charged with apostasy is that of yousef naderkhani_ church of iran pastor_ which was covered widely in international media he was sentenced to three years imprisonment in when naderkhani case came up_ courts were being pressured by the regime to make use of apostasy charges in cases regarding converts however_ the courts were reluctant as apostasy cases were reserved to special religious courts for clergy religious courts were legally the only courts that could try apostasy charges and therefore only in the instance where religious cleric had converted_ would such charge be applicable instead_ in courts outside of the religious courts_ the cases involving converts would then rather be on charges of disturbing the public order than apostasy since the only significant change in the way the authorities are treating converts to christianity is the crystallization that apostasy is not applicable to converts to christianity the iranian authorities stated in to that house churches were linked to outside movements_ for example zionist movements_ and organizations abroad_ for example in the us the regime sees the efforts of evangelical movements as drive against the iranian regime as result_ evangelical churches and house churches are viewed in national security frame this view of the regime explains why some cases involving converts_ specifically leaders of house churches_ also involved charges of more political nature concerning the case of yousef nadarkhani_ christian solidarity worldwide csw said that according to the knowledge of the organisation_ nadarkhani is still living in rasht and is carrying on with his business as pastor there has been no use of apostasy on christians in iran after the case of naderkhani in which his charges were overturned today_ all charges against converts and pastors house church leaders are of political nature_ linking to allegations of threats to national security or espionage_ including links to foreign bodies and enemies of islam_ including zionists situation of converts who return to iran after having converted abroad_ in europe western borji explained that years ago_ it was possible for christian convert to be baptized in church in iran over time_ the churches that did baptize paid the price and due to gradual pressure_ this possibility has now been eliminated since converts are no longer baptized in iranian churches as no one was willing to run the risk of performing baptism christian converts consequently started travelling to turkey and other neighbouring countries to get baptized asked if house churches perform baptism_ the source said that some churches might with regard to the situation of converts who return to iran after being baptized abroad_ be it in turkey_ armenia_ uae or another country_ the source found that they may return to iran quietly and not encounter any problems if the person is already monitored by the authorities_ he or she could risk consequences upon return to iran according to aiis it is difficult to obtain information on potential risks an individual may face upon returning to iran after conversion abroad if iranian informants have gathered information regarding an individual who has returned to iran_ the authorities may arrest them for questioning it is possible that charging and conviction will follow the arrest and questioning wide group of people could be in that position students_ political activists_ family members of political persons might even be questioned as well as christian converts regarding whether baptism abroad would put person at risk from the authorities in iran_ aiis considered that the importance of baptism should be balanced against how the iranian authorities perceive convert person who has attended training and sessions abroad may be considered convert_ although he or she may not have officially been baptized asked about the situation for convert who returns to iran after having converted abroad_ in europe or western country_ mansour borji found that there would be no difference in the way the iranian authorities would deal with the case if the person is known to the authorities and they have shown an interest in him or her before he or she left the country_ there could be risk to him or her upon returning if the person is unknown to the authorities_ the source did not consider that there would be huge threat towards him or her the source referred to case of family who went back to iran and upon return_ they were threatened and followed around harassed it was considered that perhaps relatives or others had reported them to the authorities causing the harassment ultimately_ the family left iran again they had secretly begun to attend house church concerning the consequences for an individual upon return to iran after having converted abroad_ csw said that any convert who wishes to practice his or her faith upon return_ would face serious risk whether an individual has been baptized in nearby country or in europe or the us_ would not make any difference if an individual returns to iran and is not actually promoting christianity_ the fact still remains that such an individual has left the faith shia islam and thus threatens the order of the regime when asked about the consequences of returning to iran after having been baptized abroad_ elam ministries said that many iranians do go abroad and return to iran after while if the authorities in iran become aware of the fact that person has been baptized abroad such an individual may risk interrogation and repercussions the source considered that the authorities may find out that an individual has been baptized through informers and telephone internet tapping when asked about how persons who have been baptized abroad carry on with christian life upon return to iran_ it was considered that iranian converts need baptism because of their islamic background it is easier mentally to live as christian after baptism has taken place after baptism an individual will often display greater change in behaviour that will be obvious to others talking from experience_ an iranian network leader said that after he had turned christian_ he no longer used profanity or was angry as he used to be and that this change in behaviour was of course noticed by his family members and the people around him also_ after having become christian one is given the command to share one faith with others part of the teachings of the bible is evangelism and the gospel of matthew is that one should go and tell people about jesus converts wish to obey this and it is those who evangelize that the authorities want to stop it was considered that persons who return from western countries after converting would have to be very careful about doing any evangelizing when considering the situation of an individual who has converted in europe who then returns to iran_ their situation would be much the same as that of iranians who convert in iran such individuals would have to lay low and not speak openly about their conversion if their conversion is uncovered and the authorities are notified_ there is risk that such an individual will be suspected of links with foreign organizations much the same as convert who has been living in iran the source added that those who are outside of iran for extended periods of time may be more at risk in that the authorities may suspect them of spying it was further added that this counts not only for christian converts but also for other iranians asked about the situation of christian converts who return to iran after coming to turkey or another country_ and meeting with other believers_ the representatives of the union church informed the delegation that if the converts stay quiet they do not associate with other believers_ they may not be discovered and the visits to foreign country will then not make lot of difference for them the source did not consider that there would be less risk to an individual who returns to iran after being baptized in western country_ if the individual renounces the baptism and explains it to be part of strategy for coming to the west this would work for their families_ but maybe not for the government authorities converts in iran are subject to arrest_ torture and execution they would normally not be declaring their religion on job or school applications according to the representatives of the union church_ even if not known to authorities_ converts can face shunning and even honour killing by their families ethnic christian minorities armenians_ syriacs are allowed to meet and worship in strictly regulated conditions the source said that we hear that they also have difficulties_ some of which are reported in the media the united kingdom home office s_ iran_ country of origin information coi report of september stated_ inter alia_ the following the christians in parliament all party parliamentary group appg report on the persecution of christians in iran published in october stated pre revolution_ iran was seen as sympathetic towards religious minorities_ and the iranian constitution contains guarantees of fundamental human rights_ including freedom of opinion_ and protection from torture and arbitrary arrest article of the iranian constitution states that_ the investigation of individuals beliefs is forbidden_ and no one may be molested or taken to task simply for holding certain belief however_ these rights are subject to more general principle that shari law takes precedence in any conflict of law_ and so these constitutional provisions have not stopped widespread interrogation and punishment of iranians purely on the grounds of their religious beliefs the same appg report further noted that_ the iranian constitution enshrines protection of freedom of religion for christians_ jews and zoroastrians_ and there is system of registration for non muslim places of worship in reality_ however_ even the officially recognised churches face severe limitations on their freedom to worship religious demography the criminal intelligence agency cia world fact book_ updated august accessed september provided the following breakdown of religious groups in iran muslim official shia sunni other includes zoroastrian_ jewish_ christian_ and baha proposed law on apostasy the ichri report_ the cost of faith noted that_ under the pending new iranian penal code awaiting final approval_ apostasy remains uncodified however_ the code includes provision referring to article of the iranian constitution that explicitly instructs judges to utilize islamic legal sources where crimes or punishments are not covered by the code this leaves the door open for the continued practice of relying on jurisprudence that holds apostasy to be capital crime prosecution of apostates on the prosecution of apostates the landinfo report noted in practice_ people are convicted of apostasy only very rarely the same source continued_ however_ charging converts of apostasy appears to have become more common formal charges of apostasy against converts have occurred relatively seldom in iran_ but threats of such charges have been brought up during the trial as means of pressuring converts to declare that they repent and wish to return to islam in many cases the court has decided to release the convert without any charges_ or brought other charges_ such as participation in illegal house churches or for having had contact with foreign media the ichri report_ the cost of faith reported that_ the campaign has been able to document three cases of christians charged with apostasy those of mehdi dibaj_ youcef nadarkhani_ and hossein soodmand_ and one case_ that of hossein soodmand_ in which christian was executed by the state for apostasy soodmand_ convert and pastor_ was arrested in after two months in prison_ during which time he reportedly refused to renounce his faith_ soodmand was executed by hanging it is not known whether he had trial nadarkhani_ also convert and pastor_ was arrested in and subsequently sentenced to death his retrial_ granted upon appeal_ garnered international attention after pressure from the un_ the european union_ international human rights organizations_ and the vatican_ he was acquitted on apostasy charges and sentenced instead to three years imprisonment for charges linked to evangelism he was released in on time served christiansthis section should be read in conjunction with the sections on apostasy_ prosecution of apostates and muslim converts to christianity the international campaign for human rights in iran ichri report_ the cost of faith stated there are no definitive statistics on the number of christians_ and christian converts in particular_ in iran due to the lack of reliable polling in the research group world christian database wcd recorded christians in iran_ or about percent of the entire iranian population of million in iran_ there are two main categories of christians ethnic and non ethnic the majority are ethnic christians_ which refers to armenians and the assyrians or chaldeans who possess their own linguistic and cultural traditions most ethnic christians are members of their community orthodox church non ethnic christians are for the most part members of protestant churches and most_ though not all_ are converts who came from muslim backgrounds the wcd in reported approximately protestant christians in iran_ which represents about percent of the iranian christian community the iranian government does not recognize converts as christians and many converts do not report their faith publicly due to fear of prosecution thus the number of converts in iran is likely undercounted several iranian christian organizations indicated to the campaign that the number of christian converts could be as high as but such estimates could not be independently confirmed muslim converts to christianity the csw the christian solidarity worldwide report of june stated there has been noticeable increase in the harassment_ arrests_ trials and imprisonments of converts to christianity since the beginning of in various cities across iran_ with particular crackdown on individuals and groups in tehran_ kermanshah_ esfahan and shiraz although some of these detainees have been released after being asked to sign documents preventing them from attending christian meetings_ many others remain detained_ including women and the elderly there was particular upsurge of arrests during february which continued into march once again_ exorbitant bail payments have been demanded in order to secure temporary release for detained christians the renewed wave of repression has affected both the house church movement and approved denominations_ the latter_ continuation of events that occurred at the end of when the government raided church belonging to the sanctioned assemblies of god aog movement in ahwaz_ imprisoning all attendees_ including sunday school children whilst direct attacks on sanctioned churches were rare in so far has seen the arrest of the leaders of the anglican churches of st paul and st peter in iran third largest city_ esfahan in may it was reported that the head of st paul church_ pastor hekmat salimi_ had been temporarily released on bail of around see the csw report directly for further information on september the guardian reported the release from prison of christian pastor youcef nadarkhani but also noted that_ in april another pastor_ farshid fathi_ became the latest victim of state persecution of christian converts after being sentenced to six years in prison by revolutionary court_ iran christian news agency reported the uscirf report noted that_ part of the evidence offered at trial was that fathi possessed and unlawfully distributed farsi language bibles and christian literature he has spent number of months in solitary confinement and remains in prison the joint report from the danish immigration service_ the norwegian landinfo and danish refugee council fact finding mission to tehran_ iran_ ankara_ turkey and london_ united kingdom_ on conversion to christianity_ issues concerning kurds and post election protestors as well as legal issues and exit procedures november to november and january to january published february danish fact finding report reported on the risk of persecution to christian converts the majority of the sources consulted wished to remain anonymous the report included the following observations an international organization in ankara stated that the authorities perceive the evangelistic networks as sort of intelligence network and would rather go after the evangelizers and proselytizers the authorities would not go after individual converts_ but if it turns into more organized activities_ it is different issue it was added that the authorities for instance_ have not cut the tv satellite channels that disseminate christian tv according to the source_ the authorities are not chasing house church members but would rather go after the big fish those that organize and who proselytize_ as they are seen as threat to society the evangelizers who disseminate christian information are more at risk than others_ and an extreme effort is put into chasing the evangelizers_ the pastors_ according to the source asked about what could lead to the persecution of christian convert_ western embassy stressed that engaging in evangelical activity or active manifestation of one christian identity in the public sphere will risk negative attention from the authorities and create problems wearing cross would not be problem in itself it was added that person risk however_ may also depend on what the individual has done in the past_ for example_ if previous activity has been registered by the authorities on june mohabat reported that according to mohabat news_ the revolutionary court in shiraz delivered the sentences of mojtaba seyyed alaedin hossein_ mohammad reza partoei koorosh vahid hakkani_ and homayoun shokouhi to their lawyer all four christian men were found guilty of attending house church_ spreading christianity_ having contact with foreign ministries_ propaganda against the regime and disrupting national security each was sentenced to three year and eight months in prison

hussein or other senior officials of the former iraqi regime and their immediate family members_ including entities owned or controlled_ directly or indirectly_ by them or by persons acting on their

representative government of iraq and decides further that all such funds or other financial assets or economic resources shall enjoy the same privileges_ immunities_ and protections as provided under paragraph the iraq ordinance of august underwent numerous amendments_ in particular on october following the entry into force of the federal law of march on the application of international sanctions the embargo act_ in force since january and on may to take account of resolution article of the iraq ordinance provided in substance for the freezing of assets and economic resources belonging to the former iraqi government_ to senior officials thereof and to companies or bodies under the control or management of that government or its officials pursuant to the ordinance_ any person or organisation holding or managing assets covered by the freezing measure must immediately declare them to the state secretariat for economic affairs the seco see article of the iraq ordinance_ paragraph below on november sanctions committee created by security council resolution the sanctions committee and consisting of representatives of all members of the council_ was given the task of listing the individuals and entities concerned by paragraph of resolution see paragraph below for that purpose_ the committee was to keep up to date the lists of individuals and entities already compiled by the former sanctions committee_ created under resolution which had been adopted during the armed conflict between iraq and kuwait on april the sanctions committee added to the list of individuals and entities_ respectively_ the second applicant_ which had its registered office in geneva_ and the first applicant_ who was its managing director on may the applicants names were added to the list of individuals_ legal entities_ groups and organisations concerned by the national measures under article of the iraq ordinance on may the federal council also adopted_ under article paragraph of the federal constitution_ an ordinance on the confiscation of the frozen iraqi assets and economic resources and their transfer to the development fund for iraq the confiscation ordinance see paragraph below that ordinance was initially valid until june and was then extended until june the applicants indicated that confiscation procedure had been initiated in respect of their assets in switzerland_ which had been frozen since august by the federal department for economic affairs_ when the confiscation ordinance had come into force on may the first applicant_ wishing to apply directly to the sanctions committee for the removal of his name from the list_ called upon the federal department for economic affairs_ in letter of august to suspend the confiscation procedure in respect of his assets in letter of november to the chair of the committee_ the swiss government_ through their permanent representative to the united nations_ supported that application in letter of december the chair informed the applicants that the sanctions committee had received their application and that it was under consideration he asked them to send supporting documents and any additional information that might substantiate the application the first applicant replied in letter of january that he wished to give oral evidence to the sanctions committee as no action was taken on the request_ the applicants_ in letter of september sought the continuation of the confiscation procedure in switzerland on may the federal department for economic affairs sent the applicants draft decision on the confiscation and transfer of the funds that were deposited in their names in geneva in observations of june the applicants challenged that decision in three decisions of november the federal department for economic affairs ordered the confiscation of the following assets the sum of swiss francs chf belonging to the first applicant_ representing the liquidation dividend of company not the second applicant of which he had been the sole shareholder_ and deposited in the client account of swiss law firm which represented him total of chf deposited in the applicant company name with bank total of chf deposited in the applicant company name with bank the federal department for economic affairs stated the conditions in which the sums would be transferred_ within ninety days from the entry into force of the decisions_ to the bank account of the development fund for iraq in support of its decisions_ it observed that the applicants names appeared on the lists of individuals and entities drawn up by the sanctions committee_ that switzerland was bound by the resolutions of the security council and that it could only delete name from the annex to the iraq ordinance where the relevant decision had been taken by the sanctions committee the federal department further observed that the applicants had discontinued their discussions with the sanctions committee it indicated that an administrative law appeal could be lodged with the federal court against its decisions on december the security council_ being committed to ensuring that fair and clear procedures existed for placing individuals and entities on sanctions lists_ including those of the sanctions committee_ and for removing their names_ as well as for granting humanitarian exemptions_ adopted resolution which created delisting procedure see paragraph below the applicants lodged separate administrative law appeals with the federal court against each of the federal department three decisions of november seeking their annulment in support of their submissions_ they argued that the confiscation of their assets breached the property right guaranteed by article of the federal constitution and that the procedure leading to the addition of their names to the lists provided for by resolution and annexed to the iraq ordinance had breached the basic procedural safeguards enshrined in article of the international covenant on civil and political rights iccpr of december in articles and of the convention and in articles to of the federal constitution the applicants took the view that the federal court_ and before that the federal department for economic affairs_ had jurisdiction to review the legality and the conformity with the convention and the iccpr of the sanctions committee decision to add their names to the list provided for in paragraph of resolution they submitted that there was no incompatibility or conflict between the obligations under the charter and the rights guaranteed by the convention or the iccpr on december the applicants filed additional observations limited to an assessment of the impact of judgment of the federal court dated november in the case which ultimately led to the judgment in nada switzerland gc no echr on the merits of their own appeals they further sought the opportunity to present oral argument on that point copy of these observations was sent to the federal department for economic affairs for information purposes on january the applicants wrote to the federal court drawing its attention to the opinion delivered on january by the advocate general in yassin abdullah kadi_ then pending before the court of justice of the european communities cjec_ which on december became known as the court of justice of the european union_ cjeu and reiterating their request of december to present oral argument federal court judgments of january in three almost identical judgments_ the federal court dismissed the appeals_ confining itself to verifying that the applicants names actually appeared on the lists drawn up by the sanctions committee and that the assets concerned belonged to them the relevant parts of those judgments read as follows unless otherwise stated_ this is the text of the judgment concerning the first applicant on september switzerland became member of the united nations and ratified the united nations charter of june the charter rs article paragraph of the charter provides that_ in order to ensure prompt and effective action by the united nations_ its members confer on the security council primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security_ and agree that in carrying out its duties under this responsibility the security council acts on their behalf under article of the charter_ the members of the united nations agree to accept and carry out the decisions of the security council in accordance with the charter the binding nature of security council decisions concerning measures taken in accordance with articles and to maintain or restore international peace and security also stems from article paragraph of the charter_ which provides that such decisions must be carried out by the members of the united nations directly and through their action in the appropriate international agencies of which they are members the mandatory effect of security council decisions is the basis for the similar effect of decisions taken by subsidiary organs such as the sanctions committees see eric suy and nicolas angelet in jean pierre cot_ alain pellet and mathias forteau_ la charte des nations unies_ commentaire article par article_ rd edition_ economica article pp et seq it was under chapter vii articles to of the charter that the security council adopted resolution having regard to the situation in iraq_ the security council considered that it had to take measures to maintain or restore international peace and security those measures included_ in particular_ the decisions stated in paragraphs and of the resolution in particular_ the security council decided that member states were required to freeze and transfer to the development fund for iraq the assets described in paragraph of the resolution it also decided that the sanctions committee would have the task of identifying the individuals and entities referred to in paragraph at the outset_ the sanctions committee published set of guidelines for the application of paragraphs and of resolution see http www un org french sc committees indexshtml they described the manner in which the lists of individuals and entities would be drawn up and disseminated in that document the committee requests as follows the names of individuals and entities proposed for identification should be accompanied by_ to the extent possible_ narrative description of the information that forms the basis or justification for taking action pursuant to resolution the procedure is then described in the following terms the committee will reach decisions by consensus if consensus cannot be reached_ the chairman should undertake such further consultations as may facilitate agreement if after these consultations_ consensus still cannot be reached_ the matter may be submitted to the security council given the specific nature of the information_ the chairman may encourage bilateral exchanges between interested member states in order to clarify the issue prior to decision where the committee agrees_ decisions may be taken by written procedure in such cases_ the chairman will circulate to all members of the committee the proposed decision of the committee_ under the no objection procedure within three working days if no objection is received within such period_ the decision will be deemed adopted company sa and the first applicant appear on the lists of entities and individuals drawn up by the sanctions committee under number for the company and for the latter_ on the ground that its managing director is the first applicant the head of finance_ at the time_ of the iraqi secret services_ who also controls the companies sa and the second applicant three entities entrusted with the management of the assets of the former regime and its high ranking members the decision taken on november by the federal department for economic affairs to confiscate the appellant assets pursuant to the iraq ordinance and the confiscation ordinance is thus based on resolution the two judgments concerning the second applicant the second applicant appears on the lists of entities and individuals drawn up by the sanctions committee under number on the ground that its managing director is the first applicant who also controls and sa_ two entities entrusted with the management of the assets of the former regime and its high ranking members the decision taken on november by the federal department for economic affairs to confiscate the appellant assets pursuant to the iraq ordinance and the confiscation ordinance is thus based on resolution the judgment concerning the first applicant continued since november switzerland has been contracting party to the european convention on human rights however_ even though it signed_ on may additional protocol no of march which guarantees in particular the protection of property article it has not ratified it to date that protocol has not therefore come into force in respect of switzerland consequently_ in switzerland_ the protection of property is guaranteed by the federal constitution alone article under article echr_ the high contracting parties undertake to secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in section of the convention articles to echr article echr_ in particular_ grants everyone the right to fair and public hearing within reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law_ in the determination of an individual civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him or her under article echr_ everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in the convention are violated is entitled to an effective remedy before national authority even though he relies on the guarantee of the protection of property and points out that restrictions on property are possible only under the conditions laid down in article of the constitution_ the appellant is in reality only complaining of breach of procedural safeguards and not of violation of articles and of the constitution he observes that restrictions on the enjoyment of his possessions_ such as the confiscation of his property_ can be ordered only after due process under domestic law_ including substantive examination of the legal conditions for such restriction_ while ensuring the observance of fundamental rights_ basic procedural safeguards_ and defence rights_ or the right to be heard_ and in compliance with the requirement to state reasons_ the prohibition of any denial of justice_ and the equality of arms and adversarial principles see appellant observations_ ch he complains that the reasons for his inclusion on the list of the sanctions committee were never brought to his knowledge and that he was not able to comment on them or defend himself in adversarial proceedings before an independent and impartial judicial body_ this not being disputed quite rightly by the department for economic affairs in the light of the listing procedure see above_ point in this connection_ the appellant is of the opinion that switzerland is required to apply resolution but also the provisions of the european convention on human rights and those of the international covenant on civil and political rights concerning procedural safeguards he argues that there is no contradiction between those various obligations_ and that for this reason the decision appealed against should be quashed and the matter referred back for fresh confiscation proceedings before the swiss courts_ which would examine the merits of the measure in compliance with basic procedural safeguards it is therefore appropriate to examine the procedural safeguards that switzerland is required to comply with_ having regard to its obligations under the charter and resolution in the proceedings initiated by the federal department for economic affairs leading to the confiscation of the appellant assets pursuant to article paragraph of the constitution_ the confederation and the cantons comply with international law under article of the constitution_ the federal court and the other authorities are required to apply federal laws and international law international law_ within the meaning of article of the constitution_ is defined by jurisprudence as the entire body of international law that is binding on switzerland_ comprising international agreements_ customary international law_ the general rules of the law of nations and the decisions of international organisations that have mandatory effect in switzerland accordingly_ the federal court is in principle required to comply with the provisions of the charter_ united nations security council resolutions_ the european convention on human rights and the international covenant on civil and political rights article of the constitution does not_ however_ provide for any rule of conflict between the various norms of international law that are equally binding on switzerland however_ under article of the charter_ in the event of conflict between the obligations of the members of the united nations under the charter and their obligations under any other international agreement_ their charter obligations prevail this primacy is also enshrined in article of the vienna convention on the law of treaties of may vclt rs came into force in respect of switzerland on june according to legal opinion and case law_ this is an absolute and general primacy which applies regardless of the nature of the treaty which is in conflict with the charter_ whether it is bilateral or multilateral_ or whether the treaty came into force before or after the entry into force of the charter the primacy is granted not only to the obligations expressly laid down in the charter_ but also_ according to the international court of justice_ to those that stem from binding decisions of united nations organs_ in particular the binding decisions taken by the security council pursuant to article of the charter see the case concerning questions of interpretation and application of the montreal convention arising from the aerial incident at lockerbie_ icj reports paragraph see also felipe paolillo in les conventions de vienne sur le droit des traités_ commentaire article par article_ olivier corten and pierre klein eds bruylant_ brussels no on article vclt and the numerous references cited this primacy does not render null and void the treaty which is in conflict with the charter obligations_ but merely suspends the treaty for as long as the conflict remains see eric suy in les conventions de vienne sur le droit des traités_ op cit no on article vclt and the references cited moreover_ neither the european convention on human rights nor the international covenant on civil and political rights contains clauses which would_ in themselves or by virtue of another treaty_ prevail over the conflict clause that is enshrined in both article of the charter and article vclt article iccpr certainly provides that othing in the present covenant shall be interpreted as impairing the provisions of the charter of the united nations and of the constitutions of the specialized agencies which define the respective of the various organs of the united nations and of the specialized agencies in regard to the matters dealt with in the present covenant however_ according to legal opinion_ this provision simply means that the international covenant on civil and political rights cannot hinder the task of the political organs and specialised agencies which have been entrusted under the charter with duties relating to human rights see manfred nowak_ covenant on civil and political rights_ ccpr commentary_ kehl no on article iccpr_ it does not therefore establish any hierarchy between the decisions of the security council and the rights guaranteed by the iccpr the united nations as such is not party to the latter in any event it cannot be concluded that the international covenant on civil and political rights prevails over charter obligations consequently_ in the event of any conflict between switzerland obligations under the charter and those deriving from the european convention on human rights or the international covenant on civil and political rights_ the charter obligations in principle prevail over the latter_ as the appellant has not in fact denied he takes the view_ however_ that this principle is not absolute in his opinion_ the obligations arising from the charter_ in particular those imposed by resolution lose their binding character if they contravene the rules of jus cogens the appellant argues that the procedural safeguards under article iccpr and article echr constitute jus cogens norms he submits that_ in breaching those safeguards_ resolution should lose its binding effect under the heading treaties conflicting with peremptory norm of general international law jus cogens article vclt provides that treaty is void if_ at the time of its conclusion_ it conflicts with peremptory norm of general international law_ that is_ norm accepted and recognised by the international community of states as whole as norm from which no derogation is permitted and which can be modified only by subsequent norm of general international law having the same character moreover_ article vclt provides that_ if new peremptory norm of general international law emerges_ any existing treaty which is in conflict with that norm becomes void and terminates article vclt governs the consequences of the invalidity of treaty in such cases article vclt does not contain any examples of peremptory norms of general international law report of the international law commission_ commentary on art ilc yearbook ii_ pp et seq the words by the international community of states as whole do not mean that norm must be accepted and recognised as peremptory by states unanimously significant majority is sufficient by way of example_ the norms concerning the prohibition of the use of force_ slavery_ genocide_ piracy_ unequal treaties and racial discrimination are generally cited see eric suy_ op cit no on article vclt_ nguyen quoc dinh_ patrick daillier_ alain pellet_ droit international public_ th edition_ lgdj no pp et seq and joe verhoeven_ droit international public_ larcier pp et seq this list of examples does not include the rights deriving from article iccpr and article echr_ which are relied upon by the appellant their mere recognition by the international covenant on civil and political rights and the european convention on human rights does not go so far as making them peremptory norms of general international law it transpires_ moreover_ from the preparatory work in respect of article vclt and the wording of that provision that in principle there can be no regional jus cogens norms see eric suy_ op cit no on article vclt_ this is controversial matter in legal opinion_ see inter alia eva kornicker_ ius cogens und thesis basle pp et seq and the numerous references cited therein it is true that_ in the event of public emergency which threatens the life of the nation_ article paragraphs and iccpr authorises_ under certain conditions_ measures that derogate from the obligations under the covenant_ except for those deriving from articles paragraphs and and right to life_ prohibition of torture_ prohibition of slavery_ prohibition of imprisonment on the ground of inability to fulfil contractual obligation_ prohibition of retrospective criminal legislation_ recognition of legal personality_ freedom of thought_ conscience and religion article paragraphs and echr also contain public emergency clause permitting derogation from convention obligations_ similarly excluding any derogation from articles paragraph and right to life_ prohibition of torture_ prohibition of slavery_ no punishment without law some authors take the view that the rights and prohibitions listed in article paragraph iccpr and article paragraph echr correspond to the core human rights and could therefore be regarded as peremptory norms of general international law see stefan oeter_ ius cogens und der schutz der menschenrechte in liber amicorum luzius wildhaber pp et seq and pp et seq for other authors the provisions merely point in that direction see eva kornicker_ op cit pp et seq the latter opinion seems to correspond to that of the former commission on human rights recte human rights committee which found that the list of non derogable rights in article paragraph iccpr might admittedly be related to_ but not identical with_ the question whether certain human rights corresponded to peremptory norms of general international law general comments of july under article paragraph iccpr_ ch in manfred nowak_ covenant on civil and political rights_ ccpr commentary_ kehl pp et seq at in the present case it is not necessary to settle this question in so far as article iccpr and article echr do not_ in any event_ appear in the lists given in article paragraph iccpr and article paragraph echr consequently_ contrary to what the appellant has claimed_ neither the fundamental procedural safeguards_ nor the right to an effective remedy_ under articles and echr and article iccpr_ have per se the nature of peremptory norms of general international law jus cogens in particular in the context of the confiscation procedure affecting the appellant property see_ to the same effect_ the judgment of the swiss federal court no of november in the case of nada dfe_ point judgment of the court of first instance of the european communities_ september yusuf and al barakaat international foundation council and commission_ reports ii_ paragraphs and judgment of the court of first instance of the european communities_ september kadi council and commission_ reports ii paragraphs and judgment of the court of first instance of the european communities_ july ayadi council_ reports ii paragraph judgment of the court of first instance of the european communities_ july hassan council and commission_ reports ii paragraph as to the rights guaranteed by articles et seq of the constitution_ this is matter of domestic law which cannot constitute jus cogens or hinder the implementation by switzerland of resolution according to the appellant_ switzerland should have sufficient latitude_ even in the light of its obligations vis vis the security council_ to fulfil its duties under article iccpr and article echr in his view it is necessary to distinguish between the question of the deletion of his name from the list of the sanctions committee and that of the confiscation of the frozen assets the question of confiscation could be dealt with in fair proceedings without contravening the charter obligations that opinion cannot be upheld the description of the measures freezing of funds or other financial assets_ immediate transfer thereof to the development fund for iraq of the individuals and entities concerned previous iraqi government_ saddam hussein or other senior officials of the former iraqi regime and their immediate family members_ including entities owned or controlled_ directly or indirectly_ by them or by persons acting on their behalf or at their direction and of the mandate given to the sanctions committee to enumerate the individuals and entities mentioned in paragraph is detailed and leaves no room for interpretation similarly_ the list of individuals and entities drawn up by the sanctions committee is not indicative in nature it is not matter of deciding whether the appellant name should be_ or is legitimately_ included on that list it is simply question of observing that his name does appear on the list in question_ which must be transposed into swiss domestic law in asserting that it should be possible to deal separately with the question of the confiscation of his assets_ the appellant overlooks the fact that the measures imposed on member states include the immediate transfer of the frozen assets to the development fund for iraq this order does not call for any interpretation_ nor does it grant any latitude in the result that it requires of member states as to the treatment of the frozen assets of persons who_ like the appellant_ are included in particular on the list of the sanctions committee being clearly ascertained_ those assets must be transferred to the development fund for iraq from that perspective_ the present case differs from case examined by the court of first instance of the european communities_ organisation des modjahedines du peuple iran council of the european union it concerned resolution of september laying down strategies to combat terrorism_ which required the member states of the united nations in that case the european community to identify individuals_ groups and entities whose funds had to be frozen_ because the resolution itself did not provide any list of the latter the court of first instance found that procedural safeguards had to be observed in the keeping of such list judgment of the court of first instance of the european communities_ december organisation des modjahedines du peuple iran council_ not yet reported in those circumstances_ contrary to what the appellant has claimed_ the implementation of resolution requires switzerland to adhere strictly to the measures introduced and to the decisions of the sanctions committee_ which_ unless found by the security council to be in breach of jus cogens norms_ does not leave any room_ even on the grounds of ensuring the procedural safeguards provided for in the european convention on human rights_ the international covenant on civil and political rights or the swiss constitution_ for an examination of the procedure by which the appellant name was added to the list issued by the sanctions committee_ or for verification of the justification for such addition the appellant further argued that article of the confiscation ordinance granted the federal court full jurisdiction to deal with the various aspects of the matter_ enabling it to find that the authority below had failed to ascertain the merits of the confiscation of his assets or_ in other words_ that the authority had wrongly accepted their confiscation solely on the basis that his name appeared on the list annexed to resolution without remedying the breach of his procedural rights under_ inter alia_ articles et seq of the constitution according to the foregoing considerations_ article of the confiscation ordinance cannot authorise the federal court_ any more than the authority below_ to verify whether the appellant inclusion on the list issued by the sanctions committee complied with the procedural safeguards of article iccpr_ article echr and articles et seq of the constitution with the exception of an examination of possible breach of jus cogens norms_ as shown above_ switzerland is thus not authorised to scrutinise the validity of security council decisions_ and in particular that of resolution not even in terms of compliance with procedural safeguards_ or to provide redress for any defects in such decisions for that could have the effect of depriving article of the charter of any effectiveness_ as would be the case if the appellant frozen assets were not confiscated and transferred to the development fund for iraq see eric suy and nicolas angelet in la charte des nations unies_ commentaire article par article_ jean pierre cot_ alain pellet and mathias forteau eds rd edition_ economica art however_ with that reservation_ switzerland is free to choose how it transposes into domestic law the obligations arising from resolution and the arrangements for transferring the frozen assets the federal council has made use of this discretion in distinguishing between the measures introduced for the freezing of the assets and those governing the transfer of frozen assets the federal department_ for its part_ suspended the confiscation procedure at the request of the appellant_ who sought to have the matter examined by the sanctions committee_ and resumed it only upon his express application with the same reservation_ the federal council was entitled to guarantee the right of the frozen asset holders to be heard before the confiscation decision was taken it was also entitled to make available an administrative law appeal against such decisions in the present case_ the appellant made full use of his right to be heard because he obtained access to the file of the federal department for economic affairs_ or at least to the relevant bank documents_ and had the opportunity to express himself before that authority he also fully availed himself of the right provided for in article of the confiscation ordinance by lodging the present administrative appeal as to that matter_ falling as it does within the jurisdiction of switzerland_ it should be noted that the applicant has not submitted any complaint of violation of articles and of the constitution in respect of the confiscation procedure see point in further complaint_ lastly_ the appellant contended that the refusal to annul the decision of the federal department for economic affairs of november for breach of procedural safeguards ran counter to the position defended on many occasions by switzerland_ the federal council or the federal department for foreign affairs_ asserting an intangible principle of respect for human rights he argued that this was an indivisible position in relation to other nations which had been disregarded by the decision of the federal department for economic affairs of november the appellant seems to be unaware of the meaning that should be given to indivisibility in the area of human rights according to legal opinion_ the principle of indivisibility of human rights means that states cannot choose between human rights in order to give priority to some over others the aim of this principle is to prevent governments from claiming to defend human rights by choosing from the list_ as they see fit_ those they accept and those they ignore see françoise bouchet saulnier_ droits de homme_ droit humanitaire et justice internationale_ actes sud pp and et seq in the present case_ to the extent that his position can be understood_ the appellant is complaining more about switzerland attitude_ which he regards as contradictory this opinion disregards the fact that the positive legal order_ as set out above_ is mandatory under article of the constitution for reasons of legal certainty switzerland cannot_ by itself_ delete the appellant name from the list drawn up by the sanctions committee_ which has sole competence for that purpose_ even if the procedure for that purpose is not fully satisfactory see judgment of november point moreover_ it is not contradictory for the federal authorities to find the system deficient and yet_ as in the present case_ to advocate and act on political level in favour of intangible respect for human rights_ especially in relation to the listing and delisting procedures applied by the sanctions committee switzerland conduct does not therefore breach articles and et seq of the constitution_ articles and echr or article iccpr_ under that head either the appeal must accordingly be dismissed the federal court finds_ however_ that_ in the context of switzerland power and freedom of implementation see point the authority below should grant the appellant brief and final period of time_ before implementing the decision of november which comes into force with the dismissal of the present appeal to allow him to apply_ should he so wish_ to the sanctions committee for new delisting procedure in accordance with the improved arrangements of resolution of december the appellant not having had the opportunity to make use of the latter because he wrongly placed all his hopes in the present administrative law appeal the appeal is thus dismissed for the foregoing reasons subsequent developments on june the applicants lodged delisting application in accordance with the procedure introduced by resolution the application was rejected on january in favourable opinion issued by the seco on september the applicants were informed that they would be authorised to make use of the assets frozen in switzerland to pay the fees charged by lawyer in the united states_ that lawyer activities being confined to their defence in connection with the swiss confiscation procedure and the delisting procedure since on four occasions the last being on february the seco_ on the basis of article paragraph of the iraq ordinance_ granted the applicants requests and authorised the release of certain sums for the payment of lawyer fees in respect of the confiscation decisions according to the information provided by the swiss government and not denied by the applicants_ the seco has released approximately chf in respect of lawyers fees and over chf in respect of court costs on march the swiss authorities stayed the execution of the confiscation decisions pending the judgment of the european court of human rights_ and that of the federal court on an application to reopen the domestic proceedings if the court were to find violation of the convention in its resolution of december the security council decided to terminate the development fund for iraq no later than june and to transfer the proceeds from that fund to the government of iraq successor arrangements account or accounts the sanctions committee continued to operate on december the federal department for economic affairs issued two other confiscation decisions in respect of assets in the name of the first applicant that were frozen in two banks_ to be paid into the successor funds of the iraqi government referring to the federal council decision of march see paragraph above the department decided that the assets concerned would remain frozen and would be transferred to the funds in question only if and when the present application was rejected by the european court of human rights_ or when the confiscation decisions of november were confirmed by the federal court in the event of review an appeal was lodged against

taliban_ the security council created the office of independent ombudsperson to assist the relevant sanctions committee in its examination of delisting requests the resolution states that the ombudsperson receives delisting requests in accordance with the procedures outlined in annex ii to the resolution and drafts for the committee comprehensive report on the completion of given period by resolutions and the security council considerably extended the duties and mandate of the ombudsperson_ who can now make recommendations concerning delisting requests if he or she recommends delisting and the relevant sanctions committee does not decide_ by consensus_ to maintain the person on the list within period of sixty days_ the person name will be deemed deleted it should be noted that the introduction of this mechanism_ together with the office of ombudsperson_ post dates the facts of the present case_ as the applicants delisting request was rejected by the sanctions committee in january it should also be noted that the applicants in the present case would not be able to avail themselves of this procedure because the ombudsperson mandate is confined to the sanctions imposed on members of al qaeda and not those applicable to the senior officials of the former iraqi regime resolution res of the un general assembly the relevant parts of resolution res of the un general assembly of december non binding read as follows the general assembly_ reaffirms that states must ensure that any measure taken to combat terrorism complies with their obligations under international law_ in particular international human rights_ refugee and humanitarian law urges states_ while ensuring full compliance with their international obligations_ to ensure the rule of law and to include adequate human rights guarantees in their national procedures for the listing of individuals and entities with view to combating terrorism opinions of the un special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism statement by scheinin on june the un special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism_ mr martin scheinin_ issued statement which contained_ in particular_ the following passage the procedures for terrorist listing and delisting by the committee of the security council do not meet international human rights standards concerning due process or fair trial therefore he takes the view that as long as proper due process is not guaranteed at the united nations level when listing individuals or entities as terrorists_ national or european union courts will need to exercise judicial review over the national or european measures implementing the sanctions report by emmerson on september mr scheinin successor_ mr ben emmerson_ submitted his annual report to the united nations general assembly he listed the key activities undertaken by the special rapporteur between april and august and evaluated the mandate of the office of the ombudsperson established by security council resolution subsequently amended and its compatibility with international human rights norms_ assessing in particular its impact on the due process deficits inherent in the council al qaeda sanctions regime the report made recommendations for amending the mandate to bring it into full conformity with international human rights norms the paragraphs of the report that are relevant for the present case read as follows footnotes omitted under the al qaida regime_ the council_ through its sanctions committee_ is responsible for designating individuals and entities on the consolidated list and for adjudicating upon applications for their removal this is inconsistent with any reasonable conception of due process_ and gives the appearance that the council is acting above and beyond the law however_ some members of the council are unwilling to cede their chapter vii powers to any form of binding review by an independent body indeed_ some argue that this would be contrary to the provisions of the charter of the united nations itself_ and therefore would be ultra vires the special rapporteur does not share this analysis while the security council is primarily political body_ rather than legal one_ it exercises both quasi legislative and quasi judicial functions in the present context under articles and of the charter_ states are required to comply with binding decisions of the council adopted under chapter vii_ even where this would entail violating their obligations under another international treaty given the presumption in international law against normative conflict_ human rights treaty bodies have developed principle of construction to the effect that council resolutions should be read subject to presumption that it was not the council intention to violate fundamental rights in the case of the al qaida sanctions regime_ however_ the language of the relevant resolutions does not allow for this approach in the world summit outcome document called upon the security council_ with the support of the secretary general_ to ensure that fair and clear procedures existed for placing individuals and entities on sanctions lists_ for removing them and for granting humanitarian exemptions on june at the conclusion of its thematic debate on the rule of law_ the security council expressed its commitment to carrying this recommendation forward the council itself has acknowledged that human rights and international law should guide counter terrorism initiatives pertinently_ the council has_ since included statement to this effect in the preamble to each of its resolutions on the sanctions regime pursuant to article of the charter_ the council has determined that international terrorism associated with al qaida represents threat to international peace and security_ and that an effective sanctions regime adopted under article is necessary to address that threat since the council lacks enforcement mechanisms of its own_ however_ it is dependent on the ability of states to implement its resolutions even if the council itself is not formally bound by international human rights law when acting under chapter vii proposition that is heavily disputed there is no doubt that member states are bound by human rights obligations when implementing council decisions experience has shown that the absence of an independent judicial review mechanism at the united nations level has seriously undermined the effectiveness and the perceived legitimacy of the regime national and regional courts and treaty bodies_ recognizing that they have no jurisdiction to review council decisions per se_ have focused their attention instead on domestic measures of implementation_ assessing their compatibility with fundamental norms of due process series of successful legal challenges has highlighted the problem by quashing implementing legislation_ or declaring it unlawful_ for precisely this reason the most recent such decision is the judgement of the grand chamber of the european court of human rights in nada switzerland the court held that restrictions on the applicant freedom of movement_ imposed by an ordinance of the swiss federal council implementing resolution as amended had violated his right to respect for his private life_ in breach of article of the european convention on human rights of much greater practical significance_ however_ was the court finding of violation under article of the convention the right to an effective domestic remedy the court concluded that in the absence of effective judicial review at the united nations level_ there was duty on state parties to the convention to provide an effective remedy under national law this implied full review on fact and law by an entity with jurisdiction to determine whether the measures were justified and proportionate in the individual case and power to order their removal the nada judgement thus echoes the approach of the european court of justice and the general court in the kadi litigation_ holding that regional implementing measures taken by the european commission were to be judged against human rights standards binding on the community institutions however_ the principle in the nada case has wider geographical ramifications than the kadi litigation since it applies to all member states of the council of europe_ including three permanent members of the security council foreshadowing the decision in the nada case_ the former special rapporteur had already expressed the view that as long as there is no effective and independent judicial review of listings at the united nations level it is essential that listed individuals and entities have access to domestic judicial review of any measure implementing the sanctions pursuant to resolution however_ domestic judicial review is not an adequate substitute for due process at the united nations level since the state responsible for implementation may not have access to the full justification for the listing even if it does_ it may not have the designating state consent to reveal the information this can obstruct the ability of national or regional courts to carry out an effective judicial review more generally_ as the high commissioner for human rights has observed_ the ability of individuals and entities to challenge their listing at the national level remains constrained by the obligation on member states under articles and of the charter while none of the judicial rulings to date has directly impugned council resolutions_ their effect has been to render those resolutions effectively unenforceable if the measures cannot be lawfully implemented at the national and regional levels_ then the logic of universal sanctions falls away_ raising the spectre that targeted funds could begin migrating towards those jurisdictions that cannot lawfully implement the regime it is therefore imperative that the council find solution that is compatible with the human rights standards binding on member states as regards_ more specifically_ the due process improvements for persons whose names appeared on the list established by the un security council under resolutions and the special rapporteur found as follows footnotes omitted on december the council adopted resolution which introduced an independent ombudsperson for an initial period of months to assist the committee in its consideration of delisting requests the first ombudsperson_ kimberly prost_ former ad litem judge of the international tribunal for the prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former yugoslavia since with years experience as federal prosecutor in canada_ was appointed by the secretary general on june under resolution she was mandated to investigate delisting requests according to the procedure set out in annex ii to the resolution and to prepare comprehensive report for the committee within set time frame she is also required to report to the council twice year on the operation of her mandate there were two major shortcomings to the procedure under resolution the first was that the ombudsperson was given no formal power to make recommendations ms prost nonetheless took the view that her comprehensive reports should address_ to the defined standard_ the question whether the continued listing was justified resolution recognizes and now endorses this practice and gives the ombudsperson mandate to make consequential recommendations regarding processed delisting requests the second shortcoming was that consensus of the committee was required for delisting the most far reaching change introduced by resolution was to reverse this consensus presumption delisting recommendation by the ombudsperson now takes effect automatically days after the committee completes its consideration of the comprehensive report_ unless the committee decides otherwise by consensus if there is no consensus_ any member of the committee may refer the delisting request to the security council the trigger mechanism procedure however_ as regards an objective appearance of independence_ the structural flaws remain the same the united nations human rights committee has held that the power of an executive body to control or direct judicial body is incompatible with the notion of an independent tribunal the european court of human rights has similarly held that requirement for quasi judicial determinations to be ratified by an executive body with power to vary or rescind it contravenes the very notion of an independent tribunal this principle does not depend upon perception that the existence of such power might indirectly influence the manner in which such body handles and decides cases the very existence of an executive power to overturn the decision of quasi judicial body is sufficient to deprive that body of the necessary appearance of independence however infrequently such power is exercised_ and irrespective of whether its exercise was_ or even could have been_ at issue in any particular case it follows that_ despite the significant improvements brought about by resolution the mandate of the ombudsperson still does not meet the structural due process requirement of objective independence from the committee the special rapporteur endorses the recommendation of the high commissioner for human rights that the security council must now explore every avenue of possibility for establishing an independent quasi judicial procedure for review of listing and delisting decisions this necessarily implies that the ombudsperson comprehensive reports should be accepted as final by the committee and that the decision making powers of the committee and council should be removed to reflect this modification_ the special rapporteur invites the security council to consider renaming the office of the ombudsperson as the office of the independent designations adjudicator the special rapporteur gave the following conclusions and recommendations the special rapporteur acknowledges and welcomes the significant due process improvements brought about by resolution but nevertheless concludes that the al qaida sanctions regime continues to fall short of international minimum standards of due process_ and accordingly recommends that the mandate of the office of the ombudsperson should be amended to authorize it to receive and determine petitions from designated individuals or entities for their removal from the consolidated list and ii for the authorization of humanitarian exemptions and to render determination that is accepted as final by the al qaida sanctions committee and the security council work of the un international law commission article of the united nations

having peremptory character by the international community of states as whole so far_ relatively few peremptory norms have been recognised as such but various tribunals_ national and international_

commission the case of yassin abdullah kadi and al barakaat international foundation council of the european union and commission of the european communities and p_ eu hereinafter kadi concerned the freezing of the applicants assets pursuant to european community regulations adopted in connection with the implementation of security council resolutions and which_ among other things_ required all united nations member states to take measures to freeze the funds and other financial resources of the individuals and entities identified by the security council sanctions committee as being associated with osama bin laden_ al qaeda or the taliban in that case the applicants fell within that category and their assets had thus been frozen measure that for them constituted breach of their fundamental right to respect for property as protected by the treaty instituting the european community the ec treaty they contended that the ec regulations had been adopted ultra vires on september the court of first instance which on december became known as the general court rejected those complaints and confirmed the lawfulness of the regulations_ finding mainly that article of the un charter had the effect of placing security council resolutions above all other international obligations except for those covered by jus cogens including those arising from the ec treaty it concluded that it was not entitled to review security council resolutions_ even on an incidental basis_ to ascertain whether they respected fundamental rights mr kadi appealed to the court of justice of the european communities the cjec which on december became known as the court of justice of the european union cjeu the appeal was examined by grand chamber jointly with another case in its judgment of september the cjec found that_ in view of the internal and autonomous nature of the community legal order_ it had jurisdiction to review the lawfulness of community regulation adopted within the ambit of that order even if its purpose was to implement security council resolution it thus held that_ even though it was not for the community judicature to examine the lawfulness of security council resolutions_ it was entitled to review community acts or acts of member states designed to give effect to such resolutions_ and that this would not entail any challenge to the primacy of that resolution in international law the cjec concluded that the community judicature had to ensure the review_ in principle the full review_ of the lawfulness of all community acts in the light of the fundamental rights forming an integral part of the general principles of community law_ including the review of community measures which_ like the contested regulation_ were designed to give effect to resolutions of the security council it held_ in particular_ the following in this connection it is to be borne in mind that the community is based on the rule of law_ inasmuch as neither its member states nor its institutions can avoid review of the conformity of their acts with the basic constitutional charter_ the ec treaty_ which established complete system of legal remedies and procedures designed to enable the court of justice to review the legality of acts of the institutions case les verts parliament ecr paragraph observance of the undertakings given in the context of the united nations is required just as much in the sphere of the maintenance of international peace and security when the community gives effect_ by means of the adoption of community measures taken on the basis of articles ec and ec_ to resolutions adopted by the security council under chapter vii of the charter of the united nations in the exercise of that latter power it is necessary for the community to attach special importance to the fact that_ in accordance with article of the charter of the united nations_ the adoption by the security council of resolutions under chapter vii of the charter constitutes the exercise of the primary responsibility with which that international body is invested for the maintenance of peace and security at the global level_ responsibility which_ under chapter vii_ includes the power to determine what and who poses threat to international peace and security and to take the measures necessary to maintain or restore them although_ because of the adoption of such an act_ the community is bound to take_ under the ec treaty_ the measures necessitated by that act_ that obligation means_ when the object is to implement resolution of the security council adopted under chapter vii of the charter of the united nations_ that in drawing up those measures the community is to take due account of the terms and objectives of the resolution concerned and of the relevant obligations under the charter of the united nations relating to such implementation furthermore_ the court has previously held that_ for the purposes of the interpretation of the contested regulation_ account must also be taken of the wording and purpose of resolution which that regulation_ according to the fourth recital in the preamble thereto_ is designed to implement möllendorf and möllendorf niehuus_ paragraph and case law cited it must however be noted that the charter of the united nations does not impose the choice of particular model for the implementation of resolutions adopted by the security council under chapter vii of the charter_ since they are to be given effect in accordance with the procedure applicable in that respect in the domestic legal order of each member of the united nations the charter of the united nations leaves the members of the united nations free choice among the various possible models for transposition of those resolutions into their domestic legal order it follows from all those considerations that it is not consequence of the principles governing the international legal order under the united nations that any judicial review of the internal lawfulness of the contested regulation in the light of fundamental freedoms is excluded by virtue of the fact that that measure is intended to give effect to resolution of the security council adopted under chapter vii of the charter of the united nations what is more_ such immunity from jurisdiction for community measure like the contested regulation_ as corollary of the principle of the primacy at the level of international law of obligations under the charter of the united nations_ especially those relating to the implementation of resolutions of the security council adopted under chapter vii of the charter_ cannot find basis in the ec treaty according to the commission_ so long as under that system of sanctions the individuals or entities concerned have an acceptable opportunity to be heard through mechanism of administrative review forming part of the united nations legal system_ the court must not intervene in any way whatsoever in this connection it may be observed_ first of all_ that if in fact_ as result of the security council adoption of various resolutions_ amendments have been made to the system of restrictive measures set up by the united nations with regard both to entry in the summary list and to removal from it see_ in particular_ resolutions of december and of december those amendments were made after the contested regulation had been adopted so that_ in principle_ they cannot be taken into consideration in these appeals in any event_ the existence_ within that united nations system_ of the re examination procedure before the sanctions committee_ even having regard to the amendments recently made to it_ cannot give rise to generalised immunity from jurisdiction within the internal legal order of the community indeed_ such immunity_ constituting significant derogation from the scheme of judicial protection of fundamental rights laid down by the ec treaty_ appears unjustified_ for clearly that re examination procedure does not offer the guarantees of judicial protection in that regard_ although it is now open to any person or entity to approach the sanctions committee directly_ submitting request to be removed from the summary list at what is called the focal point_ the fact remains that the procedure before that committee is still in essence diplomatic and the persons or entities concerned having no real opportunity of asserting their rights and that committee taking its decisions by consensus_ each of its members having right of veto the guidelines of the sanctions committee_ as last amended on february make it plain that an applicant submitting request for removal from the list may in no way assert his rights himself during the procedure before the sanctions committee or be represented for that purpose_ the government of his state of residence or of citizenship alone having the right to submit observations on that request moreover_ those guidelines do not require the sanctions committee to communicate to the applicant the reasons and evidence justifying his appearance in the summary list or to give him access_ even restricted_ to that information last_ if that committee rejects the request for removal from the list_ it is under no obligation to give reasons it follows from the foregoing that the community judicature must_ in accordance with the powers conferred on it by the ec treaty_ ensure the review_ in principle the full review_ of the lawfulness of all community acts in the light of the fundamental rights forming an integral part of the general principles of community law_ including review of community measures which_ like the contested regulation_ are designed to give effect to the resolutions adopted by the security council under chapter vii of the charter of the united nations the court of first instance erred in law_ therefore_ when it held_ in paragraphs to of kadi and to of yusuf and al barakaat_ that it followed from the principles governing the relationship between the international legal order under the united nations and the community legal order that the contested regulation_ since it is designed to give effect to resolution adopted by the security council under chapter vii of the charter of the united nations affording no latitude in that respect_ must enjoy immunity from jurisdiction so far as concerns its internal lawfulness save with regard to its compatibility with the norms of jus cogens the appellants grounds of appeal are therefore well founded on that point_ with the result that the judgments under appeal must be set aside in this respect it follows that there is no longer any need to examine the heads of claim directed against that part of the judgments under appeal relating to review of the contested regulation in the light of the rules of international law falling within the ambit of jus cogens and that it is_ therefore_ no longer necessary to examine the united kingdom cross appeal on this point either furthermore_ given that in the latter part of the judgments under appeal_ relating to the specific fundamental rights invoked by the appellants_ the court of first instance confined itself to examining the lawfulness of the contested regulation in the light of those rules alone_ when it was its duty to carry out an examination_ in principle full examination_ in the light of the fundamental rights forming part of the general principles of community law_ the latter part of those judgments must also be set aside concerning the actions before the court of first instance as provided in the second sentence of the first paragraph of article of the statute of the court of justice_ the latter_ when it quashes the decision of the court of first instance_ may give final judgment in the matter where the state of proceedings so permits in the circumstances_ the court considers that the actions for annulment of the contested regulation brought by the appellants are ready for judgment and that it is necessary to give final judgment in them it is appropriate to examine_ first_ the claims made by mr kadi and al barakaat with regard to the breach of the rights of the defence_ in particular the right to be heard_ and of the right to effective judicial review_ caused by the measures for the freezing of funds as they were imposed on the appellants by the contested regulation in this regard_ in the light of the actual circumstances surrounding the inclusion of the appellants names in the list of persons and entities covered by the restrictive measures contained in annex to the contested regulation_ it must be held that the rights of the defence_ in particular the right to be heard_ and the right to effective judicial review of those rights_ were patently not respected according to settled case law_ the principle of effective judicial protection is general principle of community law stemming from the constitutional traditions common to the member states_ which has been enshrined in articles and of the echr_ this principle having furthermore been reaffirmed by article of the charter of fundamental rights of the european union_ proclaimed on december in nice oj see_ to this effect_ case unibet ecr paragraph in addition_ having regard to the court case law in other fields see_ inter alia_ case heylens and others ecr paragraph and joined cases p_ p_ to and dansk rørindustri and others commission ecr paragraphs and it must be held in this instance that the effectiveness of judicial review_ which it must be possible to apply to the lawfulness of the grounds on which_ in these cases_ the name of person or entity is included in the list forming annex to the contested regulation and leading to the imposition on those persons or entities of body of restrictive measures_ means that the community authority in question is bound to communicate those grounds to the person or entity concerned_ so far as possible_ either when that inclusion is decided on or_ at the very least_ as swiftly as possible after that decision in order to enable those persons or entities to exercise_ within the periods prescribed_ their right to bring an action observance of that obligation to communicate the grounds is necessary both to enable the persons to whom restrictive measures are addressed to defend their rights in the best possible conditions and to decide_ with full knowledge of the relevant facts_ whether there is any point in their applying to the community judicature see_ to that effect_ heylens and others_ paragraph and to put the latter fully in position in which it may carry out the review of the lawfulness of the community measure in question which is its duty under the ec treaty so far as concerns the rights of the defence_ in particular the right to be heard_ with regard to restrictive measures such as those imposed by the contested regulation_ the community authorities cannot be required to communicate those grounds before the name of person or entity is entered in that list for the first time as the court of first instance stated in paragraph of yusuf and al barakaat_ such prior communication would be liable to jeopardise the effectiveness of the freezing of funds and resources imposed by that regulation in order to attain the objective pursued by that regulation_ such measures must_ by their very nature_ take advantage of surprise effect and_ as the court has previously stated_ apply with immediate effect möllendorf and möllendorf niehuus_ paragraph nor were the community authorities bound to hear the appellants before their names were included for the first time in the list set out in annex to that regulation_ for reasons also connected to the objective pursued by the contested regulation and to the effectiveness of the measures provided by the latter in addition_ with regard to community measure intended to give effect to resolution adopted by the security council in connection with the fight against terrorism_ overriding considerations to do with safety or the conduct of the international relations of the community and of its member states may militate against the communication of certain matters to the persons concerned and_ therefore_ against their being heard on those matters however_ that does not mean_ with regard to the principle of effective judicial protection_ that restrictive measures such as those imposed by the contested regulation escape all review by the community judicature once it has been claimed that the act laying them down concerns national security and terrorism in such case_ it is none the less the task of the community judicature to apply_ in the course of the judicial review it carries out_ techniques which accommodate_ on the one hand_ legitimate security concerns about the nature and sources of information taken into account in the adoption of the act concerned and_ on the other_ the need to accord the individual sufficient measure of procedural justice see_ to that effect_ the judgment of the european court of human rights in chahal united kingdom of november reports of judgments and decisions v_ in order to assess the extent of the fundamental right to respect for property_ general principle of community law_ account is to be taken of_ in particular_ article of the first additional protocol to the echr_ which enshrines that right next_ it falls to be examined whether the freezing measure provided by the contested regulation amounts to and intolerable interference impairing the very substance of the fundamental right to respect for the property of persons who_ like mr kadi_ are mentioned in the list set out in annex to that regulation that freezing measure constitutes temporary precautionary measure which is not supposed to deprive those persons of their property it does_ however_ undeniably entail restriction of the exercise of mr kadi right to property that must_ moreover_ be classified as considerable_ having regard to the general application of the freezing measure and the fact that it has been applied to him since october the cjec therefore held that the contested regulations_ which did not provide for any remedy in respect of the freezing of assets_ were in breach of fundamental rights and were to be annulled the case of commission and others kadi in commission and others kadi judgment of july p_ and p_ eu hereinafter kadi ii concerning the same applicant on an appeal from the european commission_ which had adopted new regulation to comply with kadi the grand chamber of the cjeu confirmed that the contested regulation could not be afforded any immunity from jurisdiction on the ground that its objective was to implement resolutions adopted by the un security council under chapter vii of the un charter the cjeu reiterated that it was the task of that international organ to determine what constituted threat to international peace and security and to take the measures necessary_ by means of the adoption of resolutions under chapter vii_ to maintain or restore international peace and security_ in accordance with the purposes and principles of the united nations_ including respect for human rights after engaging in criticism of the security council sanctions process_ the cjeu ultimately preferred to look at the matter from the perspective of the member state fundamental procedural obligations in the process of the individual application of the sanction_ thus confirming the annulment of the impugned regulation in so far as it concerned mr kadi the relevant passages of the judgment read as follows in proceedings relating to the adoption of the decision to list or maintain the listing of the name of an individual in annex to regulation no respect for the rights of the defence and the right to effective judicial protection requires that the competent union authority disclose to the individual concerned the evidence against that person available to that authority and relied on as the basis of its decision_ that is to say_ at the very least_ the summary of reasons provided by the sanctions committee see_ to that effect_ the kadi judgment_ paragraphs and so that that individual is in position to defend his rights in the best possible conditions and to decide_ with full knowledge of the relevant facts_ whether there is any point in bringing an action before the courts of the european union when that disclosure takes place_ the competent union authority must ensure that that individual is placed in position in which he may effectively make known his views on the grounds advanced against him see_ to that effect_ case commission lisrestal and others ecr paragraph case mediocurso commission ecr paragraph and the judgment of november in case paragraph and case law cited as regards decision whereby_ as in this case_ the name of the individual concerned is to be maintained on the list in annex to regulation no compliance with that dual procedural obligation must_ contrary to the position in respect of an initial listing see_ in that regard_ the kadi judgment_ paragraphs to and to and france people mojahedin organization of iran_ paragraph precede the adoption of that decision see france people mojahedin organization of iran_ paragraph it is not disputed that_ in the present case_ the commission_ the author of the contested regulation_ complied with that obligation when comments are made by the individual concerned on the summary of reasons_ the competent european union authority is under an obligation to examine_ carefully and impartially_ whether the alleged reasons are well founded_ in the light of those comments and any exculpatory evidence provided with those comments see_ by analogy_ case technische universität münchen ecr paragraph case spain lenzing ecr paragraph and paragraph in that context_ it is for that authority to assess_ having regard_ inter alia_ to the content of any such comments_ whether it is necessary to seek the assistance of the sanctions committee and_ through that committee_ the member of the un which proposed the listing of the individual concerned on that committee consolidated list_ in order to obtain_ in that spirit of effective cooperation which_ under article tfeu_ must govern relations between the union and the organs of the united nations in the fight against international terrorism_ the disclosure of information or evidence_ confidential or not_ to enable it to discharge its duty of careful and impartial examination lastly_ without going so far as to require detailed response to the comments made by the individual concerned see_ to that effect_ al aqsa council and netherlands al aqsa_ paragraph the obligation to state reasons laid down in article tfeu entails in all circumstances_ not least when the reasons stated for the european union measure represent reasons stated by an international body_ that that statement of reasons identifies the individual_ specific and concrete reasons why the competent authorities consider that the individual concerned must be subject to restrictive measures see_ to that effect_ al aqsa council and netherlands al aqsa_ paragraphs and and council bamba_ paragraphs to as regards court proceedings_ in the event that the person concerned challenges the lawfulness of the decision to list or maintain the listing of his name in annex to regulation no the review by the courts of the european union must extend to whether rules as to procedure and rules as to competence_ including whether or not the legal basis is adequate_ are observed see_ to that effect_ the kadi judgment_ paragraphs to see also_ by analogy_ the judgment of march in case tay za council paragraphs to the courts of the european union must_ further_ determine whether the competent european union authority has complied with the procedural safeguards set out in paragraphs to of this judgment and the obligation to state reasons laid down in article tfeu_ as mentioned in paragraph of this judgment_ and_ in particular_ whether the reasons relied on are sufficiently detailed and specific the effectiveness of the judicial review guaranteed by article of the charter also requires that_ as part of the review of the lawfulness of the grounds which are the basis of the decision to list or to maintain the listing of given person in annex to regulation no the kadi judgment_ paragraph the courts of the european union are to ensure that that decision_ which affects that person individually see_ to that effect_ the judgment of april in joined cases to gbagbo and others council paragraph is taken on sufficiently solid factual basis see_ to that effect_ al aqsa council and netherlands al aqsa_ paragraph that entails verification of the factual allegations in the summary of reasons underpinning that decision see to that effect_ and f_ paragraph with the consequence that judicial review cannot be restricted to an assessment of the cogency in the abstract of the reasons relied on_ but must concern whether those reasons_ or_ at the very least_ one of those reasons_ deemed sufficient in itself to support that decision_ is substantiated to that end_ it is for the courts of the european union_ in order to carry out that examination_ to request the competent european union authority_ when necessary_ to produce information or evidence_ confidential or not_ relevant to such an examination see_ by analogy_ zz_ paragraph that is because it is the task of the competent european union authority to establish_ in the event of challenge_ that the reasons relied on against the person concerned are well founded_ and not the task of that person to adduce evidence of the negative_ that those reasons are not well founded admittedly_ overriding considerations to do with the security of the european union or of its member states or with the conduct of their international relations may preclude the disclosure of some information or some evidence to the person concerned in such circumstances_ it is none the less the task of the courts of the european union_ before whom the secrecy or confidentiality of that information or evidence is no valid objection_ to apply_ in the course of the judicial review to be carried out_ techniques which accommodate_ on the one hand_ legitimate security considerations about the nature and sources of information taken into account in the adoption of the act concerned and_ on the other_ the need sufficiently to guarantee to an individual respect for his procedural rights_ such as the right to be heard and the requirement for an adversarial process see_ to that effect_ the kadi judgment_ paragraphs and see also_ by analogy_ zz_ paragraphs and to that end_ it is for the courts of the european union_ when carrying out an examination of all the matters of fact or law produced by the competent european union authority_ to determine whether the reasons relied on by that authority as grounds to preclude that disclosure are well founded see_ by analogy_ zz_ paragraphs and it follows from the criteria analysed above that_ for the rights of the defence and the right to effective judicial protection to be respected first_ the competent european union authority must disclose to the person concerned the summary of reasons provided by the sanctions committee which is the basis for listing or maintaining the listing of that person name in annex to regulation no ii enable him effectively to make known his observations on that subject and iii examine_ carefully and impartially_ whether the reasons alleged are well founded_ in the light of the observations presented by that person and any exculpatory evidence that may be produced by him second_ respect for those rights implies that_ in the event of legal challenge_ the courts of the european union are to review_ in the light of the information and evidence which have been disclosed inter alia whether the reasons relied on in the summary provided by the sanctions committee are sufficiently detailed and specific and_ where appropriate_ whether the accuracy of the facts relating to the reason concerned has been established in its reply of december to mr kadi comments_ the commission asserted that the indications that depositna banka was used for the planning of an attack in saudi arabia serve as partial corroboration that mr kadi had used his position for purposes other than ordinary business purposes however_ since no information or evidence has been produced to support the claim that planning sessions might have taken place in the premises of depozitna banka for terrorist acts in association with al qaeda or usama bin laden_ the indications relating to the association of mr kadi with that bank are insufficient to sustain the adoption_ at european union level_ of restrictive measures against him it follows_ from the analysis set out in paragraph and paragraphs to of this judgment_ that none of the allegations presented against mr kadi in the summary provided by the sanctions committee are such as to justify the adoption_ at european union level_ of restrictive measures against him_ either because the statement of reasons is insufficient_ or because information or evidence which might substantiate the reason concerned_ in the face of detailed rebuttals submitted by the party concerned_ is lacking subsequent case law since then the european union courts have had occasion to confirm the obligation of member states to guarantee an effective remedy as regards inclusion on the sanctions lists_ in particular following measures taken in the context of the common foreign and security policy cfsp of the european union see_ for the court of justice_ judgment of june in peftiev and others_ eu and for the general court_ judgment of march in hani el sayyed elsebai yusef_ eu judgment of june in ali sedghi and ahmad azizi_ eu judgment of june in sina bank_ eu judgment of june in abdolnaser hemmati_ eu and judgment of june in syria international islamic bank pjsc_ eu in particular_ the general court found as follows in the above cited yusef case in that regard_ the commission argument_ based on the fact that it had initiated the review procedure_ which was still underway_ and communicated to the applicant the statement of reasons which had been sent to it by the sanctions committee_ must be rejected it is settled case law that letter emanating from an institution_ stating that examination of the questions raised is in progress_ does not_ however_ constitute the definition of position which brings to an end failure to act in particular_ it is not acceptable that_ more than four years after the ruling in kadi i_ court of justice_ the commission is still not in position to discharge its obligation to examine the applicant case carefully and impartially kadi ii_ court of justice_ paragraphs and where appropriate in effective cooperation with the sanctions committee kadi ii_ court of justice_ paragraph furthermore_ according to the statements made at the hearing_ the commission continues to regard itself as strictly bound by the findings of the sanctions committee and as not having any discretion in that regard_ in contradiction with the principles laid down by the court in kadi and kadi ii_ court of justice in particular in paragraphs and and by the general court in its kadi ii judgment accordingly_ it must be held that the way in which the commission purports_ by implementing the review procedure with regard to the applicant case_ to remedy the infringements of the same kind as those found by the court of justice in its judgment in kadi i_ is formal and artificial in nature un human rights committee case of sayadi and vinck belgium in the case brought by nabil sayadi and patricia vinck against belgium views of the human rights committee of october concerning communication no the human rights committee had occasion to examine the national implementation of the sanctions regime established by the security council in resolution the two complainants authors of the communication both belgian nationals_ had been placed on the lists appended to that resolution in january on the basis of information which had been provided to the security council by belgium_ shortly after the commencement of domestic criminal investigation in september they had submitted several delisting requests at national_ regional and un levels_ all to no avail in the brussels court of first instance had ordered the belgian state_ inter alia_ to apply urgently to the sanctions committee for the deletion of the names in question_ and the state had subsequently done so in the human rights committee opinion_ although the state party itself was not competent to remove the names from the list_ it had the duty to do all it could to obtain that deletion as soon as possible_ to provide the complainants with compensation_ to make public the requests for delisting_ and to ensure that similar violations did not occur in the future on july the complainants names were removed from the list pursuant to decision of the sanctions committee as regards article of the iccpr_ the human rights committee found as follows with regard to the allegation of violation of article paragraph the authors contend that they were placed on the sanctions list and their assets frozen without their being given access to relevant information justifying the listing_ and in the absence of any court ruling on the matter the authors also draw attention to the prolonged imposition of those sanctions and maintain that they did not have access to an effective remedy_ in violation of article paragraph of the covenant the committee notes_ in this connection_ the assertion of the state party that the authors did have remedy_ since they took the state party to the brussels court of first instance and obtained an order requiring it to submit de listing request to the sanctions committee based solely on consideration of the actions of the state party_ the committee therefore finds that the authors did have an effective remedy_ within the limits of the jurisdiction of the state party_ which guaranteed effective follow up by submitting two requests for de listing the committee is of the view that the facts before it do not disclose any violation of article paragraph or of article paragraph of the covenant iv relevant case law of other statesa the case of ahmed and others hm treasury united kingdom supreme court the case of ahmed and others hm treasury_ examined by the supreme court of the united kingdom on january concerned the freezing of the appellants assets in accordance with the sanctions regime introduced by resolutions and the supreme court held that the government had acted ultra vires the powers conferred upon it by section of the united nations act in making certain orders to implement security council resolutions on sanctions in particular_ lord hope_ deputy president of the supreme court_ made the following observations the consequences of the orders that were made in this case are so drastic and so oppressive that we must be just as alert to see that the coercive action that the treasury have taken really is within the powers that the act has given them even in the face of the threat of international terrorism_ the safety of the people is not the supreme law we must be just as careful to guard against unrestrained encroachments on personal liberty he acknowledged that the appellants had been deprived of an effective remedy and in that connection found as follows would hold that is entitled to succeed on the point that the regime to which he has been subjected has deprived him of access to an effective remedy as mr swift indicates_ seeking judicial review of the treasury decision to treat him as designated person will get him nowhere answers to that description because he has been designated by the committee what he needs if he is to be afforded an effective remedy is means of subjecting that listing to judicial review this is something that_ under the system that the committee currently operates_ is denied to him would hold that article of the aqo al qaeda order which has this effect_ is ultra vires section of the act it is not necessary to consider for the purposes of this case whether the aqo as whole is ultra vires except to say that am not to be taken as indicating that article of that order_ had it been applicable in case_ would have survived scrutiny would treat hay case in the same way he too is designated person by reason of the fact that his name is on the committee list as has already been observed_ the united kingdom is now seeking that his name should be removed from it by letter dated october the treasury sanctions team informed his solicitors that the de listing request was submitted on june but that at the committee first consideration of it number of states were not in position to accede to the request further efforts to obtain de listing are continuing_ but this has still not been achieved so he remains subject to the aqo in this situation he too is being denied an effective remedy the supreme court found unlawful both the order implementing resolution in general counter terrorism context and the order implementing the al qaeda and taliban resolutions however_ it quashed the latter only in so far as it did not provide for an effective remedy see lord brown dissenting opinion on this point the case of abdelrazik canada federal court of canada in its judgment of june in abdelrazik canada minister of foreign affairs fc the federal court of canada held that the listing procedure of the al qaeda and taliban sanctions committee was incompatible with the right to an effective remedy the case concerned ban on the return to canada of the applicant_ who had canadian and sudanese nationality_ as result of the application by canada of the security council resolutions establishing the sanctions regime the applicant was thus forced to live in the canadian embassy in khartoum_ sudan_ fearing possible detention and torture should he leave that sanctuary zinn j_ who gave the lead judgment in the case_ stated in particular add my name to those who view the committee regime as denial of basic legal remedies and as untenable under the principles of international human rights there is nothing in the listing or de listing procedure that recognizes the principles of natural justice or that provides for basic procedural fairness he further observed it is frightening to learn that citizen of this or any other country might find himself on the committee list_ based only on suspicion after reviewing the measures implementing the travel ban on the basis of the al qaeda and taliban resolutions_ the judge concluded that the applicant right to enter canada had been breached_ contrary to the provisions of the canadian charter of rights and freedoms

transport_ energy and communications the detec the federal office for the environment the foen and the federal office for energy the sfoe to take formal decision on real acts acts based on federal public law that affect rights and obligations_ but do not arise from formal rulings with view to addressing alleged omissions in climate protection their requests for legal remedy read as follows by the respondents the above noted authorities shall take all necessary actions within their competence to reduce ghg emissions to such an extent that switzerland contribution aligns with the target of holding the increase in global average temperature to well below oc above pre industrial levels_ or at the very least_ does not exceed the oc target_ thereby putting an end to the unlawful omissions undermining these targets specifically respondent shall examine the duties of the confederation under article of the federal constitution and their implementation in the climate sector under the

of the federal council_ department or federal office_ respondents or shall initiate_ without delay_ preliminary legislative procedure for an emission reduction target as laid out in the request at andd respondent shall inform parliament as stated in the request at whether the proposed emissions reduction target is in compliance with the constitution and the echr the respondents shall take all necessary mitigation measures within their competence to meet the ghg reduction target defined in the request at namely reducing ghg emissions by at least below levels by thereby putting an end to their unlawful omissions in particular respondent shall consider measures to achieve the target as defined in the request at respondent shall communicate the appropriate measures to reach the target as stated in the request at respondents or shall_ with regard to the request at above_ include measures to achieve the target in the preliminary legislative procedure respondents shall carry out all acts_ within their competence_ required to lower emissions by to such an extent that switzerland contribution aligns with the well below oc target or_ at the very least_ does not exceed the oc target_ thus ending the unlawful omissions inconsistent with these targets in particular respondents or shall_ in the course of the preliminary legislative procedure_ carry out all actions that allow switzerland to do its share to meet the well below oc target or_ at the very least_ to not exceed the oc target_ which means domestic reduction of ghg emissions of at least below levels by respondents

for the period ending in alternatively_ with regard to the requests and declaratory ruling shall be issued finding the respective omissions unlawful as well as the following procedural motion the requests for legal remedies shall be enacted in timely manner in their memorial submitted to the detec_ the applicants pointed out_ in particular_ that the aim of their request was to compel the authorities_ in the interest of safeguarding their lives and health_ to take all necessary measures required by the constitution and the convention to prevent the increase of the global temperature as regards their individual circumstances_ the applicants pointed to the nature and mission of the applicant association and_ as regards the rest of them_ contended that they were members of most vulnerable group affected by climate change evidence showed that the life and health of older women were more severely impacted by periods of heatwaves than the rest of the population they submitted that this could be seen in their cases as they all had various health impairments affected by heatwaves_ and such adverse effects would exacerbate with time owing to the predicted rise in the frequency and duration of heatwaves the applicants further explained that they considered the current domestic emissions reduction targets insufficient_ and incompatible with the convention and international law they also considered the mitigation measures taken by the authorities to be insufficient in their view_ the authorities had no justification for their inaction in the field of climate change the applicants contended that the above noted omissions violated the sustainability principle article of the constitution the precautionary principle article of the constitution and the right to life article of the constitution and also their rights under the convention_ in particular the right to life_ to health_ and to physical integrity protected in article and article of the convention in relation to the positive duty to protect specifically_ they argued that the state had duty to put in place the necessary regulatory framework and administration_ taking into account the particular situation in question and the level of risk furthermore_ the applicants relied on articles and of the convention they argued_ in particular_ that their request concerned serious and genuine dispute over their civil rights and obligations within the meaning of article of the convention_ since the omissions at issue posed serious risk to their lives_ health and physical integrity they were therefore entitled to have their request assessed by the authorities and ultimately court this was_ in their view_ the intention and purpose of the remedy under section of the apa_ which_ by the nature of things_ was being used in the present case to contest omissions and claim protection under the convention however_ and independently of section of the apa_ the applicants considered that their request should be examined_ having regard to the requirements of articles and of the convention on april the detec rejected the applicants request for lack of standing the detec explained that an action under section of the apa was subject to the following conditions there had to be real act the request had to concern federal public law the authority concerned had to be federal administrative authority the real act had to affect rights or obligations there had to be an interest worthy of protection and the principle of subsidiarity had to be observed while_ in principle_ the detec accepted that the conditions under to had been fulfilled_ it considered that the condition under namely_ that the real act had to affect rights or obligations had not been met_ which made it irrelevant to discuss the conditions under to the detec held that the main aim of the applicants request to the federal administrative authorities had been to initiate the enactment of legislative provisions to reduce co emissions that action was not comparable with an order individual specific order or at least with general order general specific order as required by section of the apa in the detec view_ the general purpose of the applicants request was to achieve reduction in co emissions worldwide and not only in their immediate surroundings the detec considered that no individual legal positions were affected in the case in issue as the applicants request did not serve to specifically realise such individual positions_ but rather aimed to have general_ abstract regulations and measures put in place the detec therefore considered that section of the apa did not apply_ as legislative procedures were not regulated by that act and the applicants had other means at their disposal to engage in the exercise of their political rights for similar reasons_ the detec rejected the applicants convention arguments focusing on article of the convention_ the detec found that the applicants were pursuing general public interests_ which could not provide the basis for them having victim status under the convention the detec also held that article of the convention allowed only the review of concrete state act in relation to an individual person_ which was not the situation in the case at hand proceedings in the federal administrative court the applicants appeal on may the applicants lodged an appeal with the federal administrative court the fac against the detec decision they requested that the impugned decision be quashed and remitted to the detec for re examination in their appeal the applicants reiterated their arguments regarding the effects of climate change made before the detec see paragraphs above and argued that their request was not aimed at obtaining the adoption of general_ abstract regulations_ but rather specific actions in the context of preliminary legislative proceedings as well as the correct implementation of the existing law such request_ in the applicants view_ fell within the scope of section of the apa the applicants also argued that the detec had violated their right to be heard by not entering into the details of their request and particularly their arguments based on the convention the fac decision on november the fac dismissed the applicants appeal with regard_ first_ to the applicants standing to lodge the appeal_ the fac held that applicants nos had an interest worthy of protection in the revocation or amendment of the impugned detec decision_ which made the appeal admissible from that perspective the fac therefore considered that it was unnecessary to determine whether the applicant association had such an interest as well the fac then examined the applicants complaint as regards the breach of their right to be heard it found that_ while the detec decision lacked reasoning_ in the circumstances of the case at hand it was clear that the applicants request had been rejected because the detec considered it to be of an actio popularis nature as regards the remainder of the applicants arguments_ the fac explained that section of the apa reflected the guarantee of access to court provided in article of the constitution and article of the convention_ in so far as real acts were concerned it also pointed out that neither the law nor the case law defined the concept of real acts however_ the fac considered that_ as regards the substantive area of application of section of the apa_ the decisive factor was the question whether need for individual legal protection existed moreover_ in order to restrict the area of application as was necessary to exclude actio popularis claims_ the other criteria mentioned in section of the apa namely_ an interest worthy of protection and rights and obligations being affected were to be applied the concept of an interest worthy of protection which derived primarily from fundamental rights_ required that there should be an existing interest and practical benefit in pursuing it moreover_ the appellant had to be affected in way that differed from the general population_ which was criterion intended to exclude actio popularis proceedings as regards potential infringements of fundamental rights_ it was necessary to examine the material scope of the right in question in order to determine whether the right was affected or not this assessment was to be carried out in the circumstances of particular case examining the applicants case from the perspective of these considerations_ and relying on the federal supreme court case law on actio popularis complaints_ the fac held that the applicants claim relating to the consequences of climate change_ and demanding the issuance of material ruling under section of the apa_ required the existence of close proximity between the applicants and the matter in dispute_ which as opposed to actio popularis claims went beyond the existence of possible proximity which the general public might claim in this connection_ while accepting that over the course of the twenty first century climate change would affect switzerland in all its regions and seasons_ the fac considered that the impacts of climate change on people_ animals and plants would be of general nature_ even if not all would be impacted equally the fac reasoned_ in particular_ as follows the adverse effects vary among different population groups in terms of economic and health impacts for the population in cities and agglomerations_ for example_ heatwaves are health burden because of the formation of heat islands heatwaves in the summer can put infants and small children at risk as well because of their susceptibility to dehydration_ and high ozone levels owing to the heat can bring about respiratory disorders and impairment of pulmonary function in addition_ the changed geographic areas of carriers of disease such as ticks and mosquitoes will newly affect parts of the population which had previously not been exposed to such risks climate change_ and in particular the associated change of average temperature and average amounts of precipitation also impact forestry_ agriculture_ winter tourism and water management_ for example in addition_ because of the thawing permafrost_ the danger of rockslides is increasing_ and_ particularly in the winter_ also the risk of flooding_ debris flows and landslides however_ the fac considered that the group of women older than would not be particularly affected by the impacts of climate change such as to allow them to lodge an action under section apa it noted the following although different groups are affected in different ways_ ranging from economic interests to adverse health effects affecting the general public_ it cannot be said from the perspective of the administration of justice_ having regard to the case law as described above_ that the proximity of the appellants to the matter in dispute climate protection on the part of the confederation was close_ compared with the general public thus_ the appellants have no sufficient interest worthy of protection_ for which reason the authority of first instance rightly refused to issue material ruling in terms of section apa as regards the applicants reliance on article and subsidiarily on article of the convention_ concerning the protection of their rights under articles and of the convention_ the fac held that the applicability of article of the convention required_ inter alia_ the existence of genuine dispute of serious nature_ the outcome of which was directly decisive for the civil claim in question according to the fac_ this meant that claim should be asserted in formal terms in reasonable way and that article should be interpreted in conjunction with article of the convention_ which regulated the conditions for lodging individual applications before the court and excluded the possibility of actio popularis complaints in this respect_ as regards the applicants specific complaints_ the fac reasoned as follows neither preliminary legislative proceedings nor the requested provision of information to the public as requested by the appellants can make direct contribution toward reducing ghg emissions in switzerland in line with the case law summarised above rather_ this depends on the decisions of the legislature and regulators as well as of each individual concerned the requested actions are therefore not appropriate for reducing the risk of heatwaves during the summer the same applies inasmuch as the appellants demand the introduction of emission reduction measures not currently provided for by law in this factual situation_ it cannot be said that genuine dispute of serious nature was brought before the first instance authority the outcome of which would have proven to be directly decisive for any possible civil claims by the appellants reduction of the general risk of danger cannot be achieved directly through the requested actions the first instance authority was therefore not obliged on the basis of article of the convention to enter into the matter of the appellants and to issue material ruling which would open up the path to appeal and thus provide for protection through the courts with this outcome_ it is not necessary to examine article of the convention either the guarantee in terms of article of the convention is absorbed in full by article of the convention in civil disputes finally_ the fac summarised its findings in the following manner in summary_ the appellants are not affected by the confederation climate protection measures in way that goes beyond that of the general public their legal requests_ inasmuch as they are based on section of the apa and demand further actions to reduce ghg emissions_ are therefore to be qualified as inadmissible actio popularis the first instance authority rightly did not enter into the matter further claims to the issuance of material ruling do not result from the convention either therefore_ the appeal is to be dismissed proceedings in the federal supreme court the applicants appeal on january the applicants lodged an appeal in the federal supreme court the fsc against the fac judgment they requested that it be quashed_ and the case remitted to the detec for examination on the merits or_ alternatively_ to the fac for its reassessment in their appeal_ the applicants relied on articles and of the constitution and articles and of the convention the applicants argued that they had an interest worthy of protection which was current and practical_ since_ in the absence of remedial action_ switzerland continued to emit excessive ghg emissions which increasingly impacted their lives and health as regards the applicant association_ they stressed that it was appealing on its own behalf but also in the interests of its members_ which represented vulnerable group whose health_ and potentially lives_ were particularly impacted by the consequences of global warming the applicants further contended that the fsc needed to make the necessary determination of the facts of the case since the fac had failed to do that or had done it only in rudimentary way_ particularly in relation to the possible impacts of climate change in their view_ the fac had failed to consider the issues relating to more frequent deaths and the adverse health impacts in the population group of women aged to linked to climate change they referred to the various health ailments suffered by applicants nos which made them even more vulnerable to climate change moreover_ as regards the object of the appeal before the fsc_ the applicants explained that they were challenging_ in particular_ the lower bodies determination of the procedural prerequisites for examination of the substance of their case in terms of section of the apa and articles and of the convention_ in conjunction with articles and of the constitution and articles and of the convention they complained of breach of their right to be heard_ namely the right to have proper examination of their case by the detec and the fac the applicants also referred to article of the aarhus convention see paragraph below as regards their standing to bring the present proceedings before the courts the applicants further argued that the fac had incorrectly considered that their complaint was of an actio popularis nature in their view_ as group which was particularly vulnerable to climate change_ they had right to seek protection under article of the constitution and under article of the convention moreover_ pointing to the risks to their health_ physical integrity and well being as result of global warming_ the applicants argued that excessive ghg emissions were similar to harmful air pollution and were to be considered as dangerous activities within the meaning of article of the convention on the basis of these considerations_ the applicants also considered that they had victim status under article of the convention as regards_ in particular_ their reliance on article of the convention_ the applicants argued that the fac had examined the wrong question by reviewing the connection between their legal requests and ghg emissions which it had_ moreover_ assessed incorrectly whereas it had been supposed to examine the connection between ghg emissions and the state obligation to protect their right to life under article of the constitution in this connection_ the applicants alleged that they had not had effective legal protection as required by the convention in their view_ the fac had misconstrued the concept of dispute of genuine and serious nature relevant for the applicability of article the applicants argued that their request had been aimed at addressing the omissions in climate protection on the part of the state_ thereby leading to reduction in excessive ghg emissions and the heatwaves linked to them in other words_ the outcome of the proceedings they sought to achieve was the reduction of ghg emissions and heatwaves however_ the fac had incorrectly considered that there needed to be direct connection between their requests and the reduction of ghg emissions in any event_ in the applicants view_ the fac had not properly examined the existence of link between some of the demands they had made such as the institution of preliminary legislative proceedings or the provision of information to the public and parliament and the reduction of ghg emissions and heatwaves_ and_ by extension_ the protection of their right to life guaranteed under the relevant domestic law_ namely article of the constitution according to the applicants_ there was sufficient connection between this protected civil right under domestic law and the outcome of the proceedings which they sought to achieve moreover_ citing the court case law in bursa barosu başkanlığı and others turkey no june the applicants argued that article was applicable even if their claim did not benefit only them exclusively_ but also benefited the general public the applicants also considered that the fac interpretation of article in conjunction with article of the convention had had no legal basis and been arbitrary in summary_ the applicants noted as follows the appellants dispute is genuine and serious because the outcome of the proceedings the reduction of ghg is directly decisive for their right to protection of their lives as well as for the implementation of co legislation the appellants thus have the right to access to court in terms of article of the convention as regards article of the convention_ the applicants argued that even if the fac had considered article to be inapplicable_ it had been required to examine the complaint under article in conjunction with the existence of adverse effects of climate change on their right to life under article and their right to respect for private and family life under article of the convention the fsc decision on may the fsc dismissed the applicants appeal the fsc considered that applicants nos had standing to lodge an appeal against the fac judgment the fsc_ however_ left it open whether the applicant association also had standing to lodge the appeal and considered it more appropriate to limit its considerations to applicants nos as regards the merits of the applicants appeal_ the fsc first found that the decisions of the detec and the fac had been duly reasoned_ as required by article of the constitution and article of the convention assuming that it applied with respect to the applicants reliance on section of the apa_ the fsc stressed that this provision was intended to provide legal protection against real acts and not for an actio popularis avenue this necessitated careful examination in the particular circumstances of each case of whether the person was affected in different way from the general public in other words_ it was essential that an applicant own rights were affected moreover_ the fsc explained that the term real acts under section of the apa referred to broad concept of state acts or failures to act however_ the legal protection guaranteed under that provision was restricted by the application of other admissibility criteria_ notably the requirement that the real act affect rights or obligations and that the person have an interest worthy of protection the requirement of being affected presupposed an interference actual or potential of certain gravity with the rights of an individual linked to that_ the interest worthy of protection was primarily concerned with fundamental rights_ although other legal titles might also be taken into account applying these considerations to the case in issue_ the fsc first noted that the applicants had requested large number of measures of different nature and scope which essentially amounted to request to institute preparatory work for the enactment of laws and secondary legislation however_ finding that in the light of other considerations it was not necessary to engage further with this issue_ the fsc stressed that_ according to swiss constitutional law_ proposals for shaping current policy areas should in principle be pursued by way of democratic participation the fsc further considered that the fact that the detec and the other authorities had not taken the actions requested by the applicants did not in itself mean that the rights invoked by the applicants would be violated moreover_ it did not follow from that alleged omission alone that the applicants fundamental rights would be affected with the necessary intensity_ as required under section of the apa in this connection_ the fsc held that the limit of well below oc in terms of the paris agreement was not expected to be exceeded in the near future relying on the special report oc global warming of the panel on climate change ipcc the fsc concluded that global warming would reach oc around the year likely range to provided that it continued at the current rate oc per decade_ likely range to oc per decade the limit of well below oc would accordingly be reached at later time the fsc considered that the paris agreement and the international climate protection regime based on it_ including the relevant swiss law_ were based on the assumption that the limit of well below oc would not be exceeded in the near future and that there was still some time to prevent global warming from exceeding this limit on the basis of the above considerations_ the fsc found as follows in the circumstances mentioned above_ the appellants right to life under article of the constitution and article of the convention does not appear to be threatened by the alleged omissions to such an extent at the present time that one could speak of their own rights being affected in terms of section of the apa with sufficient intensity the same applies to their private and family life and their home in terms of article of the convention and article of the constitution the alleged domestic omissions do not achieve the fundamental rights relevance required under section to guarantee the protection of individual rights therefore_ section of the apa_ which ensures the protection of individual rights_ does not apply nor do the appellants appear to be victims of violation of the above mentioned convention rights in terms of article of the convention their above mentioned rights are not affected and they are not victims within the meaning of article of the convention because their rights are not affected with sufficient intensity this is not altered by the fact that as they argue in certain cases potential victims can be victims in terms of article of the convention this also requires being affected with certain intensity which requirement is not met here in view of what has been said above_ it follows that the rights of the appellants like the rest of the population are not affected by the alleged omissions with sufficient intensity in terms of section of the apa accordingly_ their request to the above mentioned authorities for issuance of ruling on real acts does not have the aim of ensuring their individual legal protection rather_ it aims to have the climate protection measures at the federal level existing today and planned up to the year examined in the abstract for their compatibility with state obligations to protect indirectly through the requested action of state authorities it aims to initiate the tightening of these measures such procedure or actio popularis is inadmissible in terms of section of the apa_ which guarantees the protection of individual rights only article of the aarhus convention to which the appellants referred_ cannot alter this finding moreover_ the fsc considered that_ in terms of section of the apa_ the applicants legal action was of an actio popularis nature and aimed at achieving something which should more appropriately be achieved not by legal action but by political means the detec had therefore not acted in breach of section of the apa when rejecting the applicants requests as regards the applicants reliance on article of the convention_ the fsc reasoned as follows the condition that the disputed claim existing in domestic law must at least be arguable is not met in the present case in terms of domestic law_ the appellants base their alleged subjective right to have the impugned omissions ceased and to have the requested actions performed_ on the right to life under article of the constitution however_ as noted above_ the alleged omissions do not affect this fundamental right in legally relevant way therefore_ they cannot derive the requests mentioned from this right accordingly_ they have no subjective right to the declaratory ruling requested in the alternative_ namely that the alleged omissions breach fundamental rights the fac therefore rightly confirmed the detec decision not to examine the case in this respect it is therefore not necessary to address the further requirements of article of the convention lastly_ as regards the applicants complaint under article of the convention_ the fsc found that_ in the light of the findings above_ the applicants did not have an arguable claim under another provision of the convention triggering the application of article in conclusion_ the fsc stressed as follows it is clear from the considerations above that the appellants cannot use the means of individual legal protection invoked to protect themselves against the alleged omissions of the abovementioned authorities in the field of climate protection therefore_ even though their concern is readily comprehensible given the possible consequences of insufficient implementation of the paris climate agreement for older women which they highlighted_ their appeal must be dismissed facts concerning climate by the observations on climate change the work of the ipcc demonstrated that increases in ghg concentrations since around had unequivocally been caused by human activities and that the human caused global surface temperature increase from the period to the period was oc the ipcc had also found with high confidence that there was near linear relationship between cumulative anthropogenic ghg emissions and global warming human induced global warming resulted in more frequent and more intense heatwaves the ipcc had emphasised that reductions this decade largely determined whether warming could be limited to oc or oc increasing temperatures and heatwaves increased mortality which could be attributed to human induced climate change indeed_ climate change and related extreme events would significantly increase ill health and premature deaths in the near to long term globally_ heat related mortality in people over had increased by approximately between and of all the climate hazards_ heat was by far the most significant cause of death in europe increasing temperatures and heatwaves not only entailed increased mortality but also posed serious health risk heatwaves placed strain on the human body and caused dehydration and the impairment of heart and lung function_ leading to an increase in emergency hospital admissions older people and infants were particularly at risk they also contributed to dehydration_ hyperthermia_ fatigue_ loss of consciousness_ heat cramps and heat strokes_ including the aggravation of existing medical conditions such as cardiovascular_ respiratory and kidney conditions or mental illnesses and stress older adults_ women and persons with chronic diseases were at the highest risk of temperature related morbidity and mortality overall_ women aged above such as applicants nos were at greater risk of premature loss of life_ severe impairment of life and of family and private life_ owing to climate change induced excessive heat than the general population while any increase in global warming was projected to affect heat related morbidity and mortality_ the global scientific consensus was that many premature deaths and health impairments could be prevented by adhering to the oc limit the situation in switzerland per capita ghg emissions in switzerland in had been tonnes of co eq total domestic ghg emissions in switzerland in had amounted to mt co in the same year_ switzerland share of global cumulative co emissions had been these figures_ however_ excluded emissions attributable to switzerland but occurring outside of its territory external emissions such as ghg emissions from international aviation and shipping fuels tanked in switzerland these emissions had nearly doubled since and in had been equivalent to about of total domestic ghg emissions in switzerland and consumption based ghg emissions_ created by the import of goods switzerland being the world largest importer of such emissions relative to its domestic emissions the per capita footprint in that respect had been tonnes of co eq such ghg footprint had been found to be excessively high by the foen moreover_ to this had to be added the emissions caused by finance flows such as investing_ underwriting_ lending_ insurance study commissioned by the foen had shown that the investments made by the largest equity funds authorised in switzerland tended to contribution to global warming of oc the foen had therefore considered that more could be done at this level in switzerland_ the annual temperature had increased around oc since the measurements had begun in the summers of and had been the five warmest summers on record in switzerland_ with those of and being the first and second hottest since records had begun in switzerland more deaths than average occurred during hot summers almost additional heat related deaths had occurred in june and august approximately in june_ july and august in august and in june_ july and august between june and august more people over had died than statistically expected the reasons having still not been completely analysed during the heatwave_ of the additional deaths had occurred in persons over the most significant rise in mortality risk during the hot summer of had been for to year olds in august nearly of heat related deaths had occurred in older women_ almost all of whom were older than during the heatwave_ older persons had been at the highest risk of mortality_ and people aged and over had been most affected of similarly_ the heatwaves appeared predominantly to have affected people over measures taken by the swiss authorities switzerland had not transposed its nationally determined contributions ndc under international law into domestic law the current co act merely contained binding emissions reduction target for and new co act containing binding target for had been rejected in referendum on june on september the government had submitted to parliament draft amendment of the co act which was intended to apply for the period from to parliament had_ however_ agreed on another proposed amendment to the act moreover_ switzerland had never carried out an analysis of its carbon budget according to the applicants_ switzerland climate reduction targets and actions could be summarised as follows in accordance with the co act in force since domestic ghg needed to be reduced by below levels by however_ in the ipcc had stated that developed countries like switzerland had to reduce their domestic emissions by below levels by to meet the now outdated oc limit with probability the inadequacy of the solution had been recognised by the government in the government had presented new co act which had later become the rejected co act proposing an overall reduction of and domestic emissions reduction of below levels by however_ in the ipcc had found that countries such as switzerland had to achieve domestic reductions of at least and possibly as much as by for there to be probability of remaining within the now outdated oc limit this implied the need for an on average domestic reduction of by in switzerland had submitted an updated ndc_ stating that it was committed to following scientific recommendations in order to limit warming to oc and that in view of its climate neutrality target by switzerland ndc was to reduce its ghg emissions by at least by compared with levels there had been no real progression in the formally updated ndc by switzerland and the text of the current and planned national climate legislation did not reflect commitment to the oc limit moreover_ the emission reduction pathways were not in line with the oc limit in comparison to the period up to which the applicants considered as entailing an annual decrease of in they had even decreased see paragraph below section bis and ter of the co act the swiss authorities had accepted that the reduction pathway would not be sufficient to achieve switzerland ndc and that compensating for the delay in emissions reduction would be major challenge and the share of measures taken abroad would have to be significantly higher than planned for the period from to it was planned that it would be within the competence of the government to determine the spread of domestic measures within the reduction target of at least by the intention was domestic reduction of around by compared to per year at the same time_ the state had not explained how the delay could be compensated for with this domestic reduction pathway for the period from onwards_ the swiss authorities goal was to reduce ghg emissions by below levels by and to net zero by however_ the applicants pointed out that according to that legislation these targets were to be achieved only as far as possible through domestic measures they also considered that these targets were not in line with the oc objective in this connection_ taken globally_ the ipcc had considered that immediate action to limit the warming to oc required reduction in net global ghg emissions from levels of by and by by to limit the global temperature increase required limiting the overall cumulative co emissions within carbon budget to have chance of meeting the oc limit_ the remaining global carbon budget was gtco and to have an chance_ gtco thus_ according to the applicants calculation_ even applying the method of same per capita burden sharing for emissions from onwards the applicants challenged the validity of the method of equal per capita emissions as compared to highest possible ambition switzerland would have remaining carbon budget of gtco for chance of meeting the oc limit_ or gtco for an chance in scenario with reduction in co emissions by and by switzerland would have used the remaining budget around or for an chance the climate action tracker the cat had found that if all states followed switzerland approach_ warming would reach up to oc in addition_ the cat had rated switzerland fair share target as insufficient and its climate finance as insufficient indicating that substantial improvements were needed to be consistent with limiting warming to oc the cat had concluded that to do its fair share to limit global warming to oc_ switzerland had to reduce its ghg emissions to significantly below zero by reduction of between and more than below emissions similar findings had been reached in other studies however_ switzerland was pursuing strategy of purchasing emission reductions abroad and taking them into account in the national emission reduction target for which had the effect of postponing the reduction efforts switzerland itself had to undertake to be net zero in such strategy would require switzerland_ after to reduce domestic emissions to zero within very short period of time with high annual emission reduction rates that would become increasingly difficult to achieve furthermore_ most of the ghg emissions attributable to switzerland occurred abroad the swiss authorities had at first recognised that they should be taken into account when setting climate targets however_ this did not form part of their current legislative proposals or of the updated ndc in this context_ the financial sector had considerable influence on ghg emissions however_ according to the amended co act the finance sector would be included in national climate law only in and with limited effect_ since it would merely be obliged to review the financial risks of climate change and not to make financial flows compatible with climate compatible emissions pathway the swiss authorities also recognised that they had missed their own climate target even after the covid restrictions_ ghg emissions were rising again significantly some sectors and most notably the building and transport sectors in the cantons were not properly supervised and some sectors such as the agricultural and financial sectors were not regulated the planned emission reduction measures for were similar to those in the co act and these measures would not be able to achieve domestic reduction of around by at the same time_ oc compatible domestic pathway was technically and economically feasible however_ switzerland would need to achieve full decarbonisation in line with the oc limit and should step up the taking of the measures abroad in order to meet its fair share target submissions by the government the government considered that the situation concerning climate change in switzerland_ and the measures taken in that respect_ should be viewed in two separate phases the first concerned the measures taken before the adoption of the fsc judgment of may in the applicants case see paragraphs above and the second related to the measures taken after the adoption of that judgment the first phase the co act applying the kyoto protocol envisaged that ghg emissions in switzerland should be reduced by compared to levels by this corresponded to an average reduction of in the period between and which was the international objective fixed by switzerland under the kyoto protocol the federal council had relied on the available scientific data when fixing the objective for the period up until the fourth ipcc report of had noted that the concentration of ghg in the atmosphere should be stabilised at level of to ppm of the equivalent co in order to avoid dangerous climate change in this way_ it would have been possible to limit the rise in temperature to or even oc compared to the pre industrial period to achieve this objective_ it was necessary to reduce ghg emissions at the global level from to to of co equivalent per inhabitant at most such an objective would have required reduction in ghg emissions of at least to globally and an to reduction at the national level of industrialised countries until compared to industrialised countries therefore had to reduce their emissions by to until compared to in this connection_ the objective fixed by switzerland compared to levels corresponded to the objective set by its principal commercial partners_ notably the european union moreover_ although the federal council had envisaged the possibility of increasing the relevant level of reduction of ghg emissions to it had not ultimately pursued this possibility by the end of the relevant legislation on climate had envisaged the following measures imposing co tax on fossil fuels and creating benefits for the construction sector_ technology_ households and enterprises requiring all installations emitting significant levels of ghg emissions to participate in the eu emissions trading system ensuring the undertaking of emissions reduction by small and mid size installations emitting ghg emissions aligning domestic legislation with eu requirements relating to the ghg emissions emanating from passenger cars obliging the importers of fossil fuels to compensate for certain proportion of co emissions taking measures in the field of waste management in order to reduce ghg emissions coordination of the relevant adaptation measures and provision of information and education on climate change these measures_ as well as measures taken in other areas_ in particular agriculture and energy_ should have enabled switzerland to reduce its emissions by to compared to according to the relevant assessment switzerland had just barely missed this target in ghg emissions had been some below levels owing to the mild winter_ in emissions had been particularly low in buildings and the measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic had further contributed to reduction of transport related emissions however_ only the industrial sector had achieved the fixed objective emissions from the building and transport sectors and other emissions had been above the target level on average over the period from to switzerland had reduced its ghg emissions by around compared to levels since the federal council had put in place the national strategy of climate change adaptation measures which identified the measures that needed to be taken in different sectors to address the issues of climate change while this strategy was at the federal level_ at the local and cantonal levels many measures could be taken by the relevant authorities under the co act the federal council had envisaged sixty three adaptation measures for the period between and which included_ among others_ measures of protection against heatwaves some further scientific reports on the matter had also been published including foen report which had found that the increase in heat stress and the damage to human health it caused were among the main risks of climate change in switzerland other adaptation measures had also been adopted in switzerland had also established national centre for climate services which was in charge of coordinating various climate services at the federal level moreover_ and in reaction to the heatwaves in the summer of since the federal office of meteorology and climatology meteoswiss had been publishing heatwaves alerts_ and the federal office for public health had been publishing recommendations on how to deal with the effects of heatwaves various adaptation measures had accordingly been taken at the cantonal level to protect the population during heatwaves furthermore_ as regards the planning for the period between and on february switzerland had been the first country to provide its ndc it was committed to reducing its ghg emissions by by compared to which represented an average reduction of over the period from to it had also set an indicative reduction target of to by when setting these targets_ switzerland had relied on the available scientific evidence contained notably in the fifth ipcc report switzerland considered that its commitment to reduce emissions by by compared to would correspond to the recommendations in the ipcc report_ namely of reducing global emissions by to by compared to switzerland also noted that its responsibility for ghg emissions had been limited since it only produced around of global emissions and its per capita emissions had been within the international average moreover_ it was taking measures to reduce ghg emissions by ratifying the paris agreement_ switzerland had made definite commitment to halve its ghg emissions by and reduce them by on average per year over the period from to compared to in the federal council had proposed legislation to implement this commitment but_ despite its acceptance by parliament_ it had been rejected in referendum on june the parliamentary deliberations on the complete revision of the co act had been delayed in parliament had therefore decided to proceed with partial revision of the co act in force at the time by extending the time limit for the measures provided for and setting reduction target for according to which ghg emissions were to be limited by compared to the objective represented_ in particular_ legal basis for determining the applicable compensation rate for importers of fossil fuels and the level of the co tax increase in august the federal council had decided that as of switzerland should no longer emit more ghg than could be absorbed by natural sinks and stored by technical installations net zero emissions target this corresponded to the scientific evidence established in the ipcc special report oc global warming cited above the same scientific basis underpinned the objectives set out in the strategy adopted by switzerland see paragraph below the second phase on september parliament had enacted new co act which had been intended to implement swiss commitments under the paris agreement and fix the objectives for the period until reduce emissions by by and by for the period from to each time relative to the new co act_ envisaging comprehensive set of measures to achieve those objectives_ had been supposed to come into force on january however_ on june it had been rejected in referendum in order to avoid legislative lacuna_ on december parliament had decided to enact partial revision of the existing co act in accordance with this solution_ the reduction target for the years to was per year compared to on the understanding that from maximum of of this reduction could be achieved by measures implemented abroad these objectives were independent of the reduction objective of set for the period until and they were susceptible to further amendments in the meantime_ on september the federal council had defined the next steps of swiss climate policy it had sought to address_ in particular_ the concerns expressed in the popular vote relating to fears of an increase in the cost of living and in particular possible rise in the price of petrol_ which had led to the rejection of the new co act the federal council had therefore established the following guiding principles for the new legislation keeping the instruments of the existing co act no new taxes additional financial aid to the sectors and population affected and the development of sustainable aviation fuel furthermore_ on december the federal council had started the consultation process on the revision of the co act for the period after the consultation process had ended in april and in september of that year the federal council had issued communication regarding revision of the co act for the period after the following measures had been envisaged reintroduction of the co tax and_ for determined period_ an increase in climate protection benefits financial support for biogas installations and the encouragement of energetic planning in the municipalities lowering of the co emission target values applicable to new vehicles in cooperation with the european union introduction of the relevant climate protection measures in the transport sector the development of sustainable aviation fuel in coordination with the european union an increase in the maximum share of emissions that had to be offset by petrol importers to compensation measures in switzerland and abroad introduction of possible co tax exemption for companies which were willing to put in place the relevant offsetting measures and introduction of an obligation for the financial sector supervision authorities to review the risks linked to climate change all these measures_ combined with the use of new developing technologies_ should allow switzerland to maintain its reduction target of by the federal council had considered that the measures implemented in switzerland should lead to reduction of emissions by some the legislative process with view to enacting this legislation was currently ongoing there had also been developments in the domestic legislation in relation to popular initiatives to combat climate change_ in particular the initiative pour les glaciers that sought to establish in the constitution prohibition of ghg emission by the federal council had opposed certain aspects of this initiative_ considering that it had gone too far on august the federal council had made counter legislative proposal considering that it would be more appropriate to introduce an obligation to reduce consumption of fossil fuels_ save in some exceptional circumstances such as when needed for the military_ police or other security services parliament had finally_ on september passed the law on climate protection_ innovation and strengthening energy security the climate act which had put in place the principle of net zero emissions target by this act approved by popular vote on june provided for an intermediate target for reduction compared to and for the years to average reduction of and to average reduction of it had also set indicative values for the reduction of emissions in the building_ transport and industry sectors for the years and significant budget had already been put in place in order to meet the objectives of this act the climate act corresponded to the climate strategy for drafted by the federal council in january several months before the publication of the sixth ipcc report in adopting this strategy_ switzerland had_ albeit with month delay_ complied with its commitments under the paris agreement by showing that it could reduce its ghg emissions to close to by the building and transport sectors would be able to cut their emissions by and emissions from energy consumption in the industry sector could also be eliminated by reduction in emissions of at least compared to was also possible in the agricultural sector as regards the adaptation measures_ on the basis of preliminary assessments of the situation_ in august the federal council had adopted the second climate change adaptation plan the major novelty of this plan was the putting in place of the prevention of heat stress measure_ which aimed to protect the population from the heat_ specifically the workforce moreover_ various other measures had been put in place to address the adverse effects of heatwaves switzerland was currently in the process of drafting its next climate change adaptation plan for the period after at the international level_ on december switzerland had submitted its new ndc_ setting out the target of reducing ghg emissions by at least by compared to compared to the objective announced in that of had been characterised by the following elements the reduction target had gone from to at least and the indicative reduction target from below to below until complemented by the target of ghg neutrality by switzerland had also kept the parties to the paris agreement duly informed of developments at the domestic level facts in relation to climate change emerging from the material available to the court with view to its examination of the present case_ and having regard to the two other cases being examined by the grand chamber see paragraph above in which rulings are being delivered on the same day_ as well as other pending cases stayed at the chamber level_ the court deems it necessary to highlight the following factual elements which emerge from the material available to it as early as when there was less scientific evidence and knowledge than there is at present_ the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc noted in its preamble that human activities have been substantially increasing the atmospheric concentrations of ghg_ that these increases enhance the natural greenhouse effect_ and that this will result on average in an additional warming of the earth surface and atmosphere and may adversely affect natural ecosystems and humankind this was further developed in the of the commitments under the unfccc by the adoption of the kyoto protocol including its doha amendment and of the paris agreement as legally binding international treaty on climate change the preamble to the latter instrument acknowledged_ in particular_ that climate change is common concern of humankind_ and that parties should_ when taking action to address climate change_ respect_ promote and consider their respective obligations on human rights_ the right to health_ the rights of indigenous peoples_ local communities_ migrants_ children_ persons with disabilities and people in vulnerable situations and the right to development_ as well as gender equality_ empowerment of women and equity more recently_ in the acknowledgment expressed in the paris agreement was reiterated in the glasgow climate pact which also expressed alarm and utmost concern as regards human activity induced global warming_ and the paris agreement was also endorsed in the cop sharm el sheikh implementation plan and similar findings have been reached in the cop decision see paragraph below for its part the eu recognised in the european climate law he existential threat posed by climate change which required enhanced ambition and increased climate action by the union and the member states similar position has been adopted in the recent developments on climate change in the various initiatives and instruments adopted at the un level_ notably as regards the recognition of human right to clean_ healthy and sustainable environment un general assembly resolution the court further notes that by defining the paris agreement targets the states formulated_ and agreed to_ the overarching goal of limiting warming to well below oc above pre industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to oc above pre industrial levels recognising that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change article since then_ scientific knowledge has developed further and states have recognised that the impacts of climate change will be much lower at the temperature increase of oc compared with oc and thus resolved to pursue further efforts to limit the temperature increase to oc see glasgow climate pact_ paragraph and sharm el sheikh implementation plan_ paragraph indeed_ in this connection_ the conference of parties to the unfccc_ in its decision adopting the paris agreement_ invited the ipcc to provide special report on the impacts of global warming of oc above pre industrial levels and related global ghg emission pathways cp paragraph the ipcc report in question ipcc special report oc global warming cited above found that human induced warming had reached approximately oc above pre industrial the period levels in increasing at oc per decade high confidence ambitious mitigation actions were therefore considered indispensable to limit warming to oc the report further found that any increase in global temperature such as oc was projected to affect human health_ with primarily negative consequences high confidence lower risks were projected at oc than at oc for heat related morbidity and mortality very high confidence and for ozone related mortality if emissions needed for ozone formation remained high high confidence the report also noted with alarm that in line with the then existing emission commitments under the paris agreement ndcs global warming was expected to surpass oc above pre industrial levels_ even if those pledges were supplemented with very challenging increases in the scale and ambition of mitigation_ after high confidence thus_ net zero co emissions would be required in less than fifteen years_ and lower ghg emissions in would lead to higher chance of keeping peak warming to oc high confidence in particular_ limiting warming to oc implied reaching net zero co emissions globally around and concurrent deep reductions in emissions of non co forcers high confidence the ipcc report sought to quantify mitigation requirements in terms of oc pathways that refer to carbon budgets the report explained that cumulative co emissions would be kept within budget by reducing global annual co emissions to net zero this assessment suggested remaining budget of about gtco for two thirds chance of limiting warming to oc_ and of about gtco for an even chance medium confidence at the same time_ staying within remaining carbon budget of gtco implied that co emissions would have to reach carbon neutrality in about thirty years_ reduced to twenty years for gtco remaining carbon budget high confidence moreover_ non co emissions contributed to peak warming and affected the remaining carbon budget in its subsequent assessment reports ar the ipcc came to similar conclusions confirming and updating its findings in the special report thus_ in ar climate change the physical science basis cited above the ipcc unequivocally confirmed that anthropogenic climate change has produced various adverse effects for humans and nature and created risks for further such effects in the future_ in particular in relation to global warming according to the report_ global surface temperature would continue to increase until at least the middle of the century under all emissions scenarios considered_ and global warming of oc and oc would be exceeded during the twenty first century unless deep reductions in co and other ghg emissions occurred in the coming decades on the other hand_ with further global warming_ changes in several climatic impact drivers would be more widespread at oc compared to oc global warming and even more widespread and or pronounced for higher warming levels the report also confirmed the ipcc earlier findings high confidence that there was near linear relationship between cumulative anthropogenic co emissions and the global warming they caused thus_ limiting human induced global warming to specific level required limiting cumulative co emissions_ reaching at least net zero co emissions_ together with strong reductions in other ghg emissions furthermore_ the report nuanced the relevant estimated remaining carbon budgets from the beginning of it explained that to have chance of meeting the oc limit_ the remaining global carbon budget was gtco and to have an chance_ gtco in ar climate change mitigation of climate change cited above the ipcc found that total net anthropogenic ghg emissions had continued to rise during the period during that period_ average annual ghg emissions had been higher than in any previous decade high confidence net anthropogenic ghg emissions had increased across all major sectors globally the report further pointed out that consistent expansion of policies and laws addressing mitigation had led to the avoidance of emissions that would otherwise have occurred however_ global ghg emissions in associated with the implementation of ndcs announced prior to the glasgow climate conference cop would make it likely that warming would exceed oc during the twenty first century it was likely that limiting warming to below oc would then rely on rapid acceleration of mitigation efforts after policies implemented by the end of were projected to result in higher global ghg emissions than those implied by ndcs high confidence in other words_ according to the findings of the ipcc_ the world was currently on trajectory that would lead to very significant adverse impacts for human lives and well being according to the above mentioned ipcc report_ global ghg emissions would be projected to peak between and at the latest before in global modelled pathways that limited warming to oc with no or limited overshoot and in those that limited warming to oc and assumed immediate action in both types of modelled pathways_ rapid and deep ghg emissions reductions follow throughout and however_ without strengthening of policies beyond those already implemented by the end of the report predicted ghg emissions to rise beyond leading to median global warming of oc to oc by medium confidence furthermore_ the report stressed that global net zero co emissions would be reached in the early in modelled pathways that limited warming to oc with no or limited overshoot_ and around the early in modelled pathways that limited warming to oc these pathways also included deep reductions in other ghg emissions reaching and sustaining global net zero ghg emissions would result in gradual decline in warming high confidence in the latest ar synthesis report climate change the ipcc noted that human activities_ principally through ghg emissions increasing with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from unsustainable energy use_ land use and land use change_ lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production across regions_ between and within countries_ and among individuals had unequivocally caused global warming_ with global surface temperature reaching oc above levels between and according to the report_ human caused climate change was already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe_ which had led to widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages to nature and people high confidence the ipcc further stressed that policies and laws addressing mitigation had consistently expanded and had already been deployed successfully in some countries_ leading to avoided and in some cases reduced or removed emissions high confidence global ghg emissions in implied by ndcs announced by october made it likely that warming would exceed oc during the twenty first century and made it harder to limit warming below oc there were gaps between projected emissions from implemented policies and those from ndcs moreover_ finance flows fell short of the levels needed to meet climate goals across all sectors and regions high confidence the ipcc warned that continued ghg emissions would lead to increasing global warming_ with the best estimate of reaching oc in the near term at the same time_ every increment of global warming would intensify multiple and concurrent hazards however_ deep_ rapid and sustained reductions in ghg emissions would lead to discernible slowdown in global warming within around two decades_ and also to discernible changes in atmospheric composition within few years high confidence while some future changes were unavoidable and or irreversible_ they could be limited by deep_ rapid and sustained global ghg emissions reductions the likelihood of abrupt and or irreversible changes increased with higher global warming levels similarly_ the probability of low likelihood outcomes associated with potentially very large adverse impacts increased with higher global warming levels high confidence adaptation options that were feasible and effective today would become constrained and less effective with increasing global warming losses and damages would also increase and additional human and natural systems would reach adaptation limits high confidence in the same report_ the ipcc stressed the importance of carbon budgets and policies for net zero emissions it noted that limiting human caused global warming required net zero co emissions cumulative carbon emissions until the time of reaching net zero co emissions and the level of ghg emission reductions this decade would largely determine whether warming could be limited to oc or oc projected co emissions from existing fossil fuel infrastructure without additional abatement would exceed the remaining carbon budget for oc high confidence as regards mitigation pathways_ the ipcc noted that all global modelled pathways that limited warming to oc with no or limited overshoot_ and those that limited warming to oc involved rapid and deep and_ in most cases_ immediate ghg emissions reductions in all sectors this decade global net zero co emissions would be reached for these pathway categories in the early and around the early s_ respectively high confidence however_ the ipcc stressed that if warming exceeded specified level such as oc_ it could gradually be reduced again by achieving and sustaining net negative global co emissions_ which would require additional deployment of carbon dioxide removal_ compared to pathways without overshoot this would_

substantially increasing the atmospheric concentrations of ghg that these increases enhance the natural greenhouse effect_ and that this will result on average in an additional warming of the earth surface and atmosphere and may adversely affect natural ecosystems and that the largest share of historical and current global emissions of ghg has originated in developed countries_ that per capita emissions in developing countries are still relatively low and that the share of global emissions originating in developing countries will grow to meet their social and development needs_ noting that there are many uncertainties in predictions of climate change_ particularly with regard to the timing_ magnitude and regional patterns that the global nature of climate change calls for the widest possible cooperation by all countries and their participation in an effective and appropriate international response_ in accordance with their common but differentiated and respective capabilities and their social and economic conditions_ recalling also that states have_ in accordance with the charter of the united nations and the principles of international law_ the sovereign right to exploit

environment of other states or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction_ recognizing that states should enact effective environmental legislation_ that environmental standards_ management objectives and priorities should reflect the environmental and developmental context to which they apply_ and that standards applied by some countries may be inappropriate and of unwarranted economic and social cost to other countries_ in particular developing countries_ recognizing that steps required to understand and address climate change will be socially and economically most effective if they are based on relevant scientific_ technical and economic considerations and continually re evaluated in the light of new findings in these that various actions to address climate change can be justified economically in their own right and can also help in solving other environmental also the need for developed countries to take immediate action in flexible manner on the basis of clear

and sustained reductions in global ghg emissions_ including reducing global carbon dioxide emissions by per cent by relative to the level and to net zero around mid century as well as deep reductions in other ghg also recognizes that this requires accelerated action in this critical decade_ on the basis of the best available scientific knowledge and equity_ reflecting common but differentiated and respective capabilities in the light of different national circumstances and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty emphasizes the urgent need for parties to increase their efforts to collectively reduce emissions through accelerated action and implementation of domestic mitigation measures in accordance with article paragraph of the paris agreement the unfccc conference of the parties cop took place in sharm el sheikh from to november the relevant parts of the adopted sharm el sheikh implementation plan provide as follows the conference of the

equal participation of women in climate action and to ensure gender responsive implementation and means of implementation_ including by fully implementing the lima work programme on gender and its gender action plan_ to raise climate ambition and achieve climate goals recognizes the role of children and youth as agents of change in addressing and responding to climate change and encourages parties to include children and youth in their processes for designing and implementing climate policy and action_ and_ as appropriate_ to consider including young representatives and negotiators into their national delegations_ recognizing the importance of equity and maintaining the stability of the climate system for future generations cop in preparation for the unfccc conference of the parties cop in dubai_ held between november and december the synthesis report on the technical dialogue of the first global stocktake under the paris agreement made the following key findings key finding since its adoption_ the paris agreement has driven near universal climate action by setting goals and sending signals to the world regarding the urgency of responding to the climate crisis while action is proceeding_ much more is needed now on all fronts key finding to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty_ governments need to support systems transformations that mainstream climate resilience and low ghg emissions development credible_ accountable and transparent actions by non party stakeholders are needed to strengthen efforts for systems transformations key finding systems transformations open up many opportunities_ but rapid change can be disruptive focus on inclusion and equity can increase ambition in climate action and support key finding global emissions are not in line with modelled global mitigation pathways consistent with the temperature goal of the paris agreement_ and there is rapidly narrowing window to raise ambition and implement existing commitments in order to limit warming to oc above pre industrial levels key finding much more ambition in action and support is needed in implementing domestic mitigation measures and setting more ambitious targets in ndcs to realize existing and emerging opportunities across contexts_ in order to reduce global ghg emissions by per cent by and further by per cent by compared with levels and reach net zero co emissions by globally key finding achieving net zero co and ghg emissions requires systems transformations across all sectors and contexts_ including scaling up renewable energy while phasing out all unabated fossil fuels_ ending deforestation_ reducing non co emissions and implementing both supply and demand side measures key finding just transitions can support more robust and equitable mitigation outcomes_ with tailored approaches addressing different contexts key finding economic diversification is key strategy to address the impacts of response measures_ with various options that can be applied in different contexts key finding as climate change threatens all countries_ communities and people around the world_ increased adaptation action as well as enhanced efforts to avert_ minimize and address loss and damage are urgently needed to reduce and respond to increasing impacts_ particularly for those who are least prepared for change and least able to recover from disasters key finding collectively_ there is increasing ambition in plans and commitments for adaptation action and support_ but most observed adaptation efforts are fragmented_ incremental_ sector specific and unequally distributed across regions key finding when adaptation is informed and driven by local contexts_ populations and priorities_ both the adequacy and the effectiveness of adaptation action and support are enhanced_ and this can also promote adaptation key finding averting_ minimizing and addressing loss and damage requires urgent action across climate and development policies to manage risks comprehensively and provide support to impacted communities key finding support for adaptation and funding arrangements for averting_ minimizing and addressing loss and damage need to be rapidly scaled up from expanded and innovative sources_ and financial flows need to be made consistent with climate resilient development to meet urgent and increasing needs key finding scaled up mobilization of support for climate action in developing countries entails strategically deploying international public finance_ which remains prime enabler for action_ and continuing to enhance effectiveness_ including access_ ownership and impacts key finding making financial flows international and domestic_ public and private consistent with pathway towards low ghg emissions and climate resilient development entails creating opportunities to unlock trillions of dollars and shift investments to climate action across scales key finding existing cleaner technologies need to be rapidly deployed_ together with accelerated innovation_ development and transfer of new technologies_ to support the needs of developing countries key finding capacity building is foundational to achieving broad ranging and sustained climate action and requires effective country led and needs based cooperation to ensure capacities are enhanced and retained over time at all levels the relevant parts of the cop first global stocktake provide as follows the conference of the parties serving as the meeting of the parties to the paris article paragraph of the paris agreement_ which provides that the agreement_ in enhancing the implementation of the convention_ including its objective_ aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change_ in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty_also recalling article paragraph of the paris agreement_ which provides that the agreement will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle of common but differentiated and respective capabilities_ in the light of different national

disabilities and people in vulnerable situations and the right to development_ as well as gender equality_ empowerment of women and equity_ context and cross cutting considerations welcomes that the paris agreement has driven near universal climate action by setting goals and sending signals to the world regarding the urgency of responding to the climate crisis underlines that_ despite overall progress on mitigation_ adaptation and means of implementation and support_ parties are not yet collectively on track towards achieving the purpose of the paris agreement and its long term goals reaffirms the paris agreement temperature goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below oc above pre industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to oc above pre industrial levels_ recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change underscores that the impacts of climate change will be much lower at the temperature increase of oc compared with oc and resolves to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to oc expresses serious concern that is set to be the warmest year on record and that impacts from climate change are rapidly accelerating_ and emphasizes the need for urgent action and support to keep the oc goal within reach and to address the climate crisis in this critical decade commits to accelerate action in this critical decade on the basis of the best available science_ reflecting equity and the principle of common but differentiated and respective capabilities in the light of different national circumstances and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty underscores article paragraph of the paris agreement_ which stipulates that the agreement will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle of common but differentiated and respective capabilities_ in the light of different national circumstances notes with alarm and serious concern the following findings of the sixth assessment report of the panel on climate change that human activities_ principally through emissions of ghg have unequivocally caused global warming of about oc that human caused climate change impacts are already being felt in every region across the globe_ with those who have contributed the least to climate change being most vulnerable to the impacts_ and_ together with losses and damages_ will increase with every increment of warming that most observed adaptation responses are fragmented_ incremental_ sector specific and unequally distributed across regions_ and that_ despite the progress made_ significant adaptation gaps still exist across sectors and regions and will continue to grow under current levels of implementation notes the following findings of the sixth assessment report of the panel on climate change that mitigation efforts embedded within the wider development context can increase the pace_ depth and breadth of emissions reductions_ as well as that policies that shift development pathways towards sustainability can broaden the portfolio of available mitigation responses and enable the pursuit of synergies with development objectives that both adaptation and mitigation financing would need to increase manyfold_ and that there is sufficient global capital to close the global investment gap but there are barriers to redirecting capital to climate action_ and that governments through public funding and clear signals to investors are key in reducing these barriers and investors_ central banks and financial regulators can also play their part that feasible_ effective and low cost mitigation options are already available in all sectors to keep oc within reach in this critical decade with the necessary cooperation on technologies and support notes with concern the pre gaps in both mitigation ambition and implementation by developed country parties and that the panel on climate change had earlier indicated that developed countries must reduce emissions by per cent below levels by which was not achieved ii collective progress towards achieving the purpose and long term goals of the paris agreement mitigation expresses concern that the carbon budget consistent with achieving the paris agreement temperature goal is now small and being rapidly depleted and acknowledges that historical cumulative net carbon dioxide emissions already account for about four fifths of the total carbon budget for per cent probability of limiting global warming to oc further recognizes the need for deep_ rapid and sustained reductions in ghg emissions in line with oc pathways and calls on parties to contribute to the following global efforts_ in nationally determined manner_ taking into account the paris agreement and their different national circumstances_ pathways and approaches transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems_ in just_ orderly and equitable manner_

other relevant provisions of this convention what constitutes sufficient interest and impairment of right shall be determined in accordance with the requirements of national law and consistently with the objective of giving the public concerned wide access to justice within the scope of this convention to this end_ the interest of any non governmental organization meeting the requirements referred to in article paragraph shall be deemed sufficient for the purpose of subparagraph above such organizations shall also be deemed to have rights capable of being impaired for the purpose of subparagraph above in addition and without prejudice to the review procedures referred to in paragraphs and above_ each party shall ensure that_ where they meet the criteria_ if any_ laid down in its national law_ members of the public have access to administrative or judicial procedures to challenge acts and omissions by private persons and public authorities which contravene provisions of its national law relating to the environment the relevant parts of the aarhus convention implementation guide provide as follows footnotes omitted while narrower than the public_ the public concerned is nevertheless still very broad with respect to the criterion of being affected this is very much related to the nature of the activity in question some of the activities subject to article of the convention may potentially affect large number of people for example_ in the case of pipelines_ the public concerned is usually in practice counted in the thousands_ while in the case of nuclear power stations the competent authorities may consider the public concerned to count as many as several hundred thousand people across several countries with respect to the criterion of having an interest the definition appears to go well beyond the kind of language that is usually found in legal tests of sufficient interest see next paragraph in particular it should be read to include not only members of the public whose legal interests or rights guaranteed under law might be impaired by the proposed activity potentially affected interests may also include social rights such as the right to be free from injury or the right to healthy environment it also applies_ however_ to category of the public that has an unspecified interest in the decision making procedure it is significant that article paragraph does not require that person must show legal interest to be member of the public concerned thus_ the term may encompass both legal interest and factual interest as defined under continental legal systems_ such as those of austria_ germany and poland under national law_ persons with mere factual interest do not normally enjoy the full panoply of rights in proceedings accorded to those with legal interest in contrast_ the convention accords the same status at least in relation to article regardless of whether the interest is legal or factual one article paragraph explicitly includes within the category of the interested public ngos whose statutory goals include promoting environmental protection_ so long as they meet any requirements under national law whether or not an ngo promotes environmental protection can be ascertained in variety of ways_ such as through its charter_ by laws or activities environmental protection can include any purpose consistent with the implied definition of environment found in article paragraph the requirement for promoting environmental protection would thus be satisfied in the case of ngos focusing on any aspect of the implied definition of environment in article paragraph for example_ if an ngo works to promote the interests of those with health concerns due to water borne diseases_ this ngo would be considered to fulfil the definition of article paragraph the reference to meeting any requirements under national law should not be read as leaving absolute discretion to parties in defining these requirements their discretion should be seen in the context of the important role the convention assigns to ngos with respect to its implementation and the clear requirement of article paragraph to provide appropriate recognition for ngos in its findings on communication accc turkmenistan the compliance committee found that non governmental organizations_ by bringing together expertise and resources_ generally have greater ability to effectively exercise their rights under the convention than individual members of the public parties may set requirements for ngos under national law_ but in the light of the integral role that ngos play in the implementation of the convention_ parties should ensure that these requirements are not overly burdensome or politically motivated_ and that each party legal framework encourages the formation of ngos and their constructive participation in public affairs moreover_ any requirements should be consistent with the convention principles_ such as non discrimination and the avoidance of technical and financial barriers within these limits_ parties may impose requirements based on objective criteria that are not unnecessarily exclusionary for example_ possible requirement for environmental ngos to have been active in that country for certain number of years might not be consistent with the aarhus convention_ because it may violate the non discrimination clause of article paragraph furthermore_ the requirement to have been active in itself might be overly exclusive in countries that have permitted the formation of ngos for only relatively short period of time_ and where they are therefore relatively undeveloped there are also sometimes requirements for ngos to have certain number of active members this was one of the issues considered by the ecj in case sweden discussed in the box above such membership requirement would also be considered overly strict under the convention_ if the threshold is set at such high level that only handful of ngos can meet it in given country in slovenia amended its environmental protection act to remove the requirement that ngos promoting environmental protection undergo financial audit of operations in order to qualify as the public concerned under article paragraph if an ngo meets the requirements set out in article paragraph it is deemed to be member of the public concerned under article and article paragraph but for ngos that do not meet such requirements ab initio_ and for individuals_ the convention is not entirely clear whether the mere participation in public participation procedure under article paragraph would qualify person as member of the public concerned because article paragraph is the mechanism for enforcing rights under article however_ it is arguable that any person who participates as member of the public in hearing or other public participation procedure under article paragraph should have an opportunity to make use of the access to justice provisions in article paragraph in this case_ he or she would fall under the definition of public concerned nothing in the convention prevents the parties from granting standing to any person without distinction however_ the convention requires as minimum that members of the public concerned either having sufficient interest or maintaining impairment of right have standing to review the substantive and procedural legality of any decision_ act or omission subject to the provisions of article with respect to ngos_ the convention states clearly that ngos meeting the requirements of article paragraph are deemed to have sufficient interest or right capable of being impaired proper implementation of_ and compliance with_ the convention requires that the objective of wide access to justice is upheld when determining the scope of persons both natural and legal with standing several parties to the convention apply some kind of test to establish standing_ often in terms of direct_ sufficient_ personal or legal interest_ or of legally protected individual right while some such criteria_ for instance limiting standing only to members of the public with private property rights_ would not be in line with the convention_ the permissibility of other criteria will depend on how they are construed by the reviewing body in practice in other words_ even criteria such as having sufficient interest or right that can be impaired may be incompatible with the convention if understood too narrowly in the case law of the reviewing bodies as illustrated by the compliance committee findings on communication accc belgium meeting the convention objective of giving the public concerned wide access to justice may require significant shift of thinking in countries where ngos have previously lacked standing in cases because they were held not to have sufficient interest_ or an impaired right in accc the belgian judiciary had applied the general criteria for standing under belgian law to ngos_ meaning that ngo applicants had to show direct_ personal and legitimate interest as well as required quality the compliance committee concluded that even though the wording of the relevant belgian laws did not as such imply lack of compliance_ the jurisprudence of the belgian courts_ as developed before the entry into force of the convention for belgium_ implied too restrictive access to justice to environmental organizations_ and thus did not meet the requirements of the convention an example of national criteria for standing that would clearly not be in compliance with the convention was the former swedish criteria for ngos according to former swedish law_ to be able to appeal environmental permits_ environmental associations were required to be active in sweden for more than three years and to have at least members this was found by the cjeu to be in violation of the eu legislation intended to implement the aarhus convention the relevant part of the maastricht recommendations on the implementation of the aarhus convention provides as follows the public concerned includes_ inter alia_ non governmental organizations ngos promoting environmental protection and meeting any requirements under national law to ensure the framework for public participation is as transparent_ clear and consistent as possible_ the following may be clearly specified through national law what constitutes having an interest in environmental decision making ii the requirements_ if any_ which ngos promoting environmental protection must meet in order to be deemed to have an interest what constitutes sufficient interest should be determined in accordance with the objective of giving the public concerned wide access to justice the united nations general assembly resolution on the human right to clean_ healthy and sustainable environment upon the invitation of the human rights council formulated in its resolution of october the general assembly of the united nations adopted its resolution on the human right to clean_ healthy and sustainable environment on july it was adopted with votes in favour of the member states present abstentions and no votes against of the member states of the council of europe voted in favour in the preamble to the resolution_ the general assembly noted the following vast majority of states have recognized some form of the right to clean_ healthy and sustainable environment through international agreements_ their national constitutions_ legislation_ laws or policies its four operative paragraphs provide as follows recognizes the right to clean_ healthy and sustainable environment as human right notes that the right to clean_ healthy and sustainable environment is related to other rights and existing international law affirms

future generations has been put on the agenda of the general assembly_ resulting in the adoption of numerous resolutions in its resolution adopted on december the general assembly made explicit reference to the necessity to protect the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations of humankind_ referring to the unfccc in the preamble to its resolution adopted on december the general assembly made statement which it has retained ever since in the preamble of each of the resolutions adopted on this subject recognizing that_ in undertaking its work_ the united nations should promote the protection of the global climate for the well being of present and future generations of humankind the secretary general of the united nations in the secretary general of the united nations noted that the united nations human rights treaty bodies all recognize the intrinsic link between the environment and the realization of range of human rights_ such as the right to life_ to health_ to food_ to water and to housing see hrc in may pursuant to the request of the human rights council the secretary general issued report on the impacts of climate change on the human rights of people in vulnerable situations in which he presented the legal and policy framework applying to persons in vulnerable situations in the context of climate change footnotes omitted the nine core international human rights instruments set forth binding legal obligations on the states that are party to them_ including some that are relevant to climate change in the context of climate change_ fulfilling these obligations may require states to_ among other things_ take action to protect people against climate change related harms that impact on the enjoyment of human rights and to implement inclusive climate policies climate action should empower people in vulnerable situations_ ensuring their full and effective participation as rights holders in the report_ the secretary general made series of recommendations to states and other stakeholders to address the impacts of climate change on the human rights of people in vulnerable situations paragraphs the human rights council resolutions in in its resolution the human rights council acknowledged that more than states had recognized some form of right to healthy environment in_ inter alia_ international agreements_ their constitutions_ legislations or policies in resolution on human rights and the environment the human rights council noted as follows recalling also the paris agreement_ adopted on december by the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change_ in which they acknowledged in the preamble that they should_ when taking action to address climate change_ respect_ promote and consider their respective obligations with regard to human rights_ the right to health_ the rights of indigenous peoples_ local communities_ migrants_ children_ persons with disabilities and people in

recalling also states obligations and commitments under multilateral environmental instruments and agreements_ including on climate change_ and the outcome of the united nations conference on sustainable development_ held in rio de janeiro_ brazil_ in june and its outcome document entitled the future we want which reaffirmed the principles of the rio declaration on environment and further all its resolutions on human rights and the environment_ the most recent of which are resolutions of october of october and of march and relevant resolutions of the general that sustainable

rights_ recognizes the right to clean_ healthy and sustainable environment as human right that is important for the enjoyment of human rights notes that the right to clean_ healthy and sustainable environment is related to other rights and existing international law affirms that the promotion of the human right to clean_ healthy and sustainable environment requires the full implementation of the multilateral environmental agreements under the principles of international environmental law the human rights council also adopted resolution on human rights and climate change of july in which it focused more closely on the implications of climate change for the full enjoyment of the right to food_ but also called upon all states to adopt comprehensive_ integrated_ gender responsive_ age inclusive and disability inclusive approach to climate change adaptation and mitigation policies_ consistent with the united nations framework convention on climate change and the objective and principles thereof on october the human rights council adopted resolution on the human rights of older persons_ in which it recognised the essential contribution that older persons made to the functioning of societies and to the achievement of the agenda for sustainable development see also resolution of july special procedures special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights in the context of climate change the mandate of the special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights in the context of climate change was established in october by the human rights council in the thematic report of july to the united nations general assembly entitled promotion and protection of human rights in the context of climate change mitigation_ loss and damage and participation the special rapporteur provided series of recommendations recommendations with respect to bridging the mitigation gap the special rapporteur maintains that all of the recommendations made by the special rapporteur on the issue of human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of safe_ clean_ healthy and sustainable environment in his report to the general assembly in with respect to mitigation action are still relevant and should be considered as recommended in the present report in addition_ the below recommendations should be considered with respect to mitigation_ the special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights in the context of climate change recommends that the general assembly establish an international human rights tribunal to hold accountable governments_ business and financial institutions for their ongoing investments in fossil fuels and carbon intensive industries and the related human rights effects that such investments invoke the special rapporteur also recommends that the general assembly encourage all member states to include youth representatives in national parliaments to highlight climate change concerns the special rapporteur further recommends that the general assembly encourage all states to give standing to children and young people_ including indigenous children and young people international_ national and subnational court systems ii special rapporteur on the issue of human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of safe_ clean_ healthy and sustainable environment in the then special rapporteur issued report which summarised the main human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of safe_ clean_ healthy and sustainable environment under the title of framework principles on human rights and the environment the subsequent rapporteur issued two thematic reports in one to the human rights council_ the other to the general assembly in his report to the human rights council of january hrc the special rapporteur focused on the right to breathe clean air as one of the human rights to safe_ clean_ healthy and sustainable environment he detailed the scope and content of human rights obligations relating to clean air in the following terms iv human rights obligations relating to clean air as the previous mandate holder made clear_ states have obligations to protect the enjoyment of human rights from environmental harm hrc the foreseeable adverse effects of poor air quality on the enjoyment of human rights give rise to extensive duties of states to take immediate actions to protect against those effects in joint statement issued in group of united nations experts said threat like this can no longer be ignored states have duty to prevent and control exposure to toxic air pollution and to protect against its adverse effects on human rights the framework principles on human rights and the environment clarify the three categories of state obligations procedural_ substantive_ and special obligations towards those in vulnerable situations therefore_ the framework principles can be operationalized in the context of air pollution in order to respect_ protect and fulfil human rights the procedural obligations of states in relation to the right to breathe clean air include duties related to promoting education and public awareness providing access to information ensuring freedom of expression_ association and assembly facilitating public participation in the assessment of proposed projects_ policies and environmental decisions and ensuring affordable_ timely access to remedies with respect to substantive obligations_ states must not violate the right to breathe clean air through their own actions must protect the right from being violated by third parties_ especially businesses and must establish_ implement and enforce laws_ policies and programmes to fulfil the right states also must avoid discrimination and retrogressive measures there are seven key steps that states must take in fulfilling the right to breathe clean air monitor air quality and impacts on human health assess sources of air pollution make information publicly available_ including public health advisories establish air quality legislation_ regulations_ standards and policies develop air quality action plans at the local_ national and_ if necessary_ regional levels implement an air quality action plan and enforce the standards and evaluate progress and_ if necessary_ strengthen the plan to ensure that the standards are met at each of these stages_ states must ensure that the public is fully informed and has an opportunity to participate in decision making processes extra effort should always be made to reach out to women_ children and others in vulnerable situations whose voices are too often not heard in environmental policy processes states must pay special attention to environmental defenders working to protect the right to clean in the report to the general assembly the special rapporteur built on the above mentioned framework principles on human rights and the environment see paragraph above and detailed the content of state obligations footnotes omitted the framework principles on human rights and the environment clarify three categories of state obligations procedural_ substantive_ and special obligations towards those in vulnerable situations the framework principles can be operationalized in the context of climate change in order to respect_ protect and fulfil human rights pursuant to international human rights law_ states have procedural obligations to provide the public with accessible_ affordable and understandable information regarding the causes and consequences of the global climate crisis_ including incorporating climate change into the educational curriculum at all levels ensure an inclusive_ equitable and gender based approach to public participation in all climate related actions_ with particular emphasis on empowering the most affected populations_ namely women_ children_ young people_ indigenous peoples and local communities_ persons living in poverty_ persons with disabilities_ older persons_ migrants_ displaced people_ and other potentially at risk communities enable affordable and timely access to justice and effective remedies for all_ to hold states and businesses accountable for fulfilling their climate change obligations assess the potential climate change and human rights impacts of all plans_ policies and proposals_ including both upstream and downstream effects both production and consumption related emissions integrate gender equality into all climate actions_ enabling women to play leadership roles respect the rights of indigenous peoples in all climate actions_ particularly their right to free_ prior and informed consent provide strong protection for environmental and human rights defenders working on all climate related issues_ from land use to fossil fuels states must vigilantly protect defenders from harassment_ intimidation and violence with respect to substantive obligations_ states must not violate the right to safe climate through their own actions must protect that right from being violated by third parties_ especially businesses and must establish_ implement and enforce laws_ policies and programmes to fulfil that right states also must avoid discrimination and retrogressive measures these principles govern all climate actions_ including obligations related to mitigation_ adaptation_ finance_ and loss and damage human rights obligations are reinforced by international environmental law_ as states are obliged to ensure that polluting activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause serious harm to the environment or peoples of other states or to areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction given the foreseeability of increasing climate impacts_ this well established no harm rule of customary international law is being violated as result of ghg emissions_ which_ regardless of where they are emitted_ are contributing_ cumulatively_ to adverse effects in other states_ including small island developing states the urgenda case in the netherlands is an important precedent_ as the court relied on international human rights law to hold the government of the netherlands accountable for fulfilling commitments the government itself says are necessary to prevent dangerous climate change states have an obligation to cooperate to achieve low carbon_ climate resilient and sustainable future_ which means sharing information the transfer of zero carbon_ low carbon and high efficiency technologies from wealthy to less wealthy states building capacity increasing spending on research and development related to the clean energy transition honouring international commitments and ensuring fair_ legal and durable solutions for migrants and displaced persons wealthy states must contribute their fair share towards the costs of mitigation and adaptation in low income countries_ in accordance with the principle of common but differentiated climate finance to low income countries should be composed of grants_ not loans it violates basic principles of justice to force poor countries to pay for the costs of responding to climate change when wealthy countries caused the problem climate actions_ including under new mechanisms being negotiated pursuant to article of the paris agreement_ must be designed and implemented to avoid threatening or violating human rights in the past_ policies supporting biofuel production contributed to spikes in food prices_ riots_ and major increase in the total number of people suffering from hunger forest preservation policies raise similar concerns about the impact on rights_ as such policies may limit access to lands used for hunting_ fishing_ gathering_ cultivation and other important cultural activities integrating actions to achieve climate targets and the sustainable development goals_ in cooperation with affected communities_ will ensure that these types of adverse outcomes are avoided in the committee on economic_ social and cultural rights warned states that failure to prevent foreseeable human rights harm caused by climate change_ or failure to mobilize the maximum available resources in an effort to do so_ could constitute breach of their obligation to respect_ protect and fulfil all human rights for all states must_ therefore_ dedicate the maximum available financial and material resources to shift to renewable energy_ clean transport and agroecological farming halt and reverse deforestation and soil deterioration and increase adaptive capacity_ especially in vulnerable and marginalized communities failure to fulfil international climate change commitments is prima facie violation of the state obligations to protect the human rights of its citizens dramatic change of direction is needed to comply with their human rights obligations_ developed states and other large emitters must reduce their emissions at rate consistent with their international commitments to meet the paris target of limiting warming to oc_ states must submit ambitious nationally determined contributions by that will put the world on track to reducing ghg emissions by at least per cent by as calculated by the panel on climate change all states should prepare rights based deep decarbonization plans intended to achieve net zero carbon emissions by in accordance with article paragraph of the paris agreement four main categories of actions must be taken addressing society addiction to fossil fuels accelerating other mitigation actions protecting vulnerable people from climate impacts and providing unprecedented levels of financial support to least developed countries and small island developing states in the report to the human rights council_ entitled right to healthy environment good practices hrc the special rapporteur summarised good practices in implementing the human right to safe_ clean_ healthy and sustainable environment_ drawn from more than states he argued that the legal recognition of this right could itself be considered good practice the relevant parts of the report read as follows iii good practices in the implementation of the right to safe_ clean_ healthy and sustainable environmenta legal recognition in the present report_ the special rapporteur focuses on the implementation of the right to safe_ clean_ healthy and sustainable environment the legal recognition of this right can itself be considered good practice_ whether by means of constitutional protection_ inclusion in environmental legislation or through ratification of regional treaty that includes the right in cooperation with the vance center for international justice_ the special rapporteur prepared an updated list of states that legally recognize the right to safe_ clean_ healthy and sustainable environment see annex ii there are states where this right enjoys constitutional protection constitutional protection for human rights is essential_ because the constitution represents the highest and strongest law in domestic legal system furthermore_ the constitution plays an important cultural role_ reflecting society values and aspirations the right to healthy environment is explicitly included in regional treaties ratified by states this includes states that are parties to the african charter on human and peoples rights_ states that are parties to the convention on access to information_ public participation in decision making and access to justice in environmental matters aarhus convention states that are parties to the additional protocol to the american convention on human rights in the area of economic_ social and cultural rights protocol of san salvador and states that are parties to the arab charter on human rights as at december five states had ratified the regional agreement on access to information_ public participation and justice in environmental matters in latin america and the caribbean escazú agreement this recent treaty requires_ however_ ratifications to enter into force ten states adopted the non binding declaration on human rights of the association of south east asian nations it is also important that legislation be enacted and implemented to respect_ protect and fulfil the right to safe_ clean_ healthy and sustainable environment there are states where this right has been incorporated into national legislation especially good practices can be seen in argentina_ brazil_ colombia_ costa rica_ france_ the philippines_ portugal and south africa_ where the right to healthy environment serves as unifying principle that permeates legislation_ regulations and policies in total_ more than per cent of states members of the united nations out of legally recognize the right to safe_ clean_ healthy and sustainable environment the special rapporteur has collected the texts of the constitutional and legislative provisions that recognize this right the special rapporteur also issued thematic reports on human rights and the global water crisis water pollution_ water scarcity and water related disasters hrc healthy and sustainable food reducing the environmental impacts of food systems on human rights and the right to clean_ healthy and sustainable environment non toxic environment hrc in the recent thematic report entitled the human right to clean_ healthy and sustainable environment catalyst for accelerated action to achieve the sustainable development goals the special rapporteur wanted to challeng the conventional wisdom that the sustainable development goals are mere aspirations_ by highlighting the extensive human rights obligations that underlie the goals the relevant recommendations in this respect include the following incorporate the right to clean_ healthy and sustainable environment at all levels global_ regional and national including in legally binding global instrument_ the universal declaration of human rights_ post global biodiversity framework_ the european convention on human rights and national constitutions_ legislation and policies acknowledge that the goals are built on robust foundation of human rights law_ establishing legally binding obligations iii independent expert on human rights and international solidarity in report submitted to the human rights council entitled international solidarity and climate change hrc the independent expert on human rights and international solidarity made series of recommendations for human rights based reform_ in relation to threats posed by climate change_ in particular all states_ corporations and international organizations should take all necessary separate and joint steps towards achieving net zero emissions by consistent with their highest possible ambitions to reduce emissions and the common objective of keeping the global temperature rise below oc under the paris agreement to that end_ states_ corporations and financial institutions_ particularly the highest emitting states_ in historical and contemporary terms_ should consider ceasing to pursue the exploration of and new investments in fossil fuels as matter of human rights based international solidarity_ since the shared carbon budget will be exceeded if already existing and proposed fossil fuel developments proceed states_ corporations and financial institutions should cooperate to ensure that any transformation of the fossil fuel economy which is imperative does not perpetuate asymmetries between richer and poorer states and peoples as countries phase down or even phase out their fossil fuel operations_ wealthier countries should provide poorer countries that are less adaptable to the transition with support based on the right to development of the poorer states_ and the social and economic rights of their people that are tied to energy systems states should cooperate through the international climate regime and international human rights community_ including through ilo_ to guarantee access to justice in the context of climate change with respect to the following rectifying loss and damage associated with the inequalities perpetuated by climate change_ including by giving this agenda the same priority as mitigation and adaptation and providing meaningful financial support to affected countries and peoples ii safeguarding the enjoyment of international human rights among indigenous peoples and local communities affected by climate change related projects_ including protecting environmental defenders from criminalization iii formulating and implementing concrete plans from the global to the local levels for just transition towards sustainable economies that ensures the right to decent work for all iv cooperating to realize international human rights obligations as they apply to marginalized groups uniquely affected by climate change_ including indigenous peoples_ the elderly_ children_ persons with disabilities_ persons living in poverty and women iv independent expert on the enjoyment of all human rights by older persons the report hrc of the independent expert noted the following negative impacts of climate change on older people the independent expert reiterates her view that the lack of comprehensive and integrated international legal instrument to promote and protect the rights and dignity of older persons has significant practical implications_ including for older persons in emergency situations she stresses in particular that current instruments do not make the issues of ageing specific or sufficiently visible_ and therefore preclude older persons from the full enjoyment of their human rights_ particularly in emergency situations in the report entitled human rights of older women the intersection between ageing and gender the independent expert added that in emergencies brought on by climate change impacts_ older women might be viewed as burden and therefore be vulnerable to abuse and neglect the specific risks and impacts for older women are_ however_ generally invisible the human rights committee the international covenant on civil and political rights iccpr does not contain any provisions explicitly aimed at environmental protection nevertheless_ the human rights committee the hrc derives specific obligations related to environmental protection from the right to life article and the right to private and family life article in its general comment no on the right to life_ adopted in the hrc reiterated the link between environmental protection and the duty to protect life connection already made by the hrc in communication from the duty to protect life also implies that states parties should take appropriate measures to address the general conditions in society that may give rise to direct threats to life or prevent individuals from enjoying their right to life with dignity these general conditions may include degradation of the environment referring to international instruments_ such as the paris agreement_ the hrc further detailed the connection between states obligations regarding the right to life and environmental preservation footnotes omitted environmental degradation_ climate change and unsustainable development constitute some of the most pressing and serious threats to the ability of present and future generations to enjoy the right to life the obligations of states parties under international environmental law should thus inform the content of article of the covenant_ and the obligation of states parties to respect and ensure the right to life should also inform their relevant obligations under international environmental law implementation of the obligation to respect and ensure the right to life_ and in particular life with dignity_ depends_ inter alia_ on measures taken by states parties to preserve the environment and protect it against harm_ pollution and climate change caused by public and private actors states parties should therefore ensure sustainable use of natural resources_ develop and implement substantive environmental standards_ conduct environmental impact assessments and consult with relevant states about activities likely to have significant impact on the environment_ provide notification to other states concerned about natural disasters and emergencies and cooperate with them_ provide appropriate access to information on environmental hazards and pay due regard to the precautionary approach in the case of portillo cáceres paraguay the hrc held as follows the committee takes note of the state party argument that the communication is inadmissible ratione materiae because environmental rights are not provided for in the covenant the committee also notes_ however_ that the authors have stated that they are not claiming violation of the right to healthy environment but rather violations of their right to life_ physical integrity_ privacy_ family life and an effective remedy and that they are doing so on the grounds that the state party has not honoured its positive obligation to protect those rights_ which_ in the case at hand_ would entail enforcing environmental standards the committee considers_ therefore_ that article of the optional protocol does not constitute an obstacle to finding of admissibility in respect of the present communication the committee also takes note of developments in other international tribunals that have recognized the existence of an undeniable link between the protection of the environment and the realization of human rights and that have established that environmental degradation can adversely affect the effective enjoyment of the right to life thus_ severe environmental degradation has given rise to findings of violation of the right to life in the present case_ the committee is of the view that heavily spraying the area in question with toxic agrochemicals an action which has been amply documented poses reasonably foreseeable threat to the authors lives given that such large scale fumigation has contaminated the rivers in which the authors fish_ the well water they drink and the fruit trees_ crops and farm animals that are their source of food consequently_ in view of the acute poisoning suffered by the authors_ as acknowledged in the amparo decision of paras and and of the death of mr portillo cáceres_ which has never been explained by the state party_ the committee concludes that the information before it discloses violation of article of the covenant in the cases of mr portillo cáceres and the authors of the present communication when pollution has direct repercussions on the right to one private and family life and home_ and the adverse consequences of that pollution are serious because of its intensity or duration and the physical or mental harm that it does_ then the degradation of the environment may adversely affect the well being of individuals and constitute violations of private and family life and the home consequently_ in the light of the information that it has before it_ the committee concludes that the events at issue in the present case disclose violation of article of the covenant in teitiota new zealand the hrc noted as follows the committee recalls that the right to life cannot be properly understood if it is interpreted in restrictive manner_ and that the protection of that right requires states parties to adopt positive measures the committee also recalls its general comment no on the right to life_ in which it established that the right to life also includes the right of individuals to enjoy life with dignity and to be free from acts or omissions that would cause their unnatural or premature death para the committee further recalls that the obligation of states parties to respect and ensure the right to life extends to reasonably foreseeable threats and life threatening situations that can result in loss of life states parties may be in violation of article of the covenant even if such threats and situations do not result in the loss of life furthermore_ the committee recalls that environmental degradation_ climate change and unsustainable development constitute some of the most pressing and serious threats to the ability of present and future generations to enjoy the right to life moreover_ the committee observes that both it and regional human rights tribunals have established that environmental degradation can compromise effective enjoyment of the right to life_ and that severe environmental degradation can adversely affect an individual well being and lead to violation of the right to life in relation to the author claims regarding the risk of violence during land disputes the committee considers that general situation of violence is only of sufficient intensity to create real risk of irreparable harm under articles or of the covenant in the most extreme cases_ where there is real risk of harm simply by virtue of an individual being exposed to such violence on return_ or where the individual in question is in particularly vulnerable situation he author has not demonstrated clear arbitrariness or error in the domestic authorities assessment as to whether he faced real_ personal and reasonably foreseeable risk of threat to his right to life as result of violent acts resulting from overcrowding or private land disputes in kiribati while recognizing the hardship that may be caused by water rationing_ the committee notes that the author has not provided sufficient information indicating that the supply of fresh water is inaccessible_ insufficient or unsafe so as to produce reasonably foreseeable threat of health risk that would impair his right to enjoy life with dignity or cause his unnatural or premature death the committee recognizes that in certain places_ the lack of alternatives to subsistence livelihoods may place individuals at heightened risk of vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate change the information made available to the committee does not indicate that when the author removal occurred_ there was real and reasonably foreseeable risk that he would be exposed to situation of indigence_ deprivation of food and extreme precarity that could threaten his right to life_ including his right to life with dignity the committee is of the view that without robust national and international efforts_ the effects of climate change in receiving states may expose individuals to violation of their rights under articles or of the covenant_ thereby triggering the non refoulement obligations of sending states furthermore_ given that the risk of an entire country becoming submerged under water is such an extreme risk_ the conditions of life in such country may become incompatible with the right to life with dignity before the risk is realized in the present case_ the committee accepts the author claim that sea level rise is likely to render kiribati uninhabitable however_ it notes that the time frame of to years_ as suggested by the author_ could allow for intervening acts by kiribati_ with the assistance of the international community_ to take affirmative measures to protect and_ where necessary_ relocate its population the committee notes that the state party authorities thoroughly examined that issue and found that kiribati was taking adaptive measures to reduce existing vulnerabilities and build resilience to climate change related harms based on the information made available to it_ the committee is not in position to conclude that the domestic authorities assessment that the measures taken by kiribati would suffice to protect the author right to life under article of the covenant was clearly arbitrary or erroneous in that regard_ or amounted to denial of justice in its views adopted on july in communication no daniel billy et al australia torres strait islanders case although not finding violation of article in that particular case_ the hrc considered that adverse climate change impacts could qualify as reasonably foreseeable threat to life article the committee notes the authors claim that the events in this case constitute violation by act and omission of their right to life with dignity under article of the international covenant on civil and political rights owing to the state party failure to perform its duty to provide adaptation and mitigation measures to address climate change impacts that adversely affect their lives_ including their way of life with respect to the state party position that article of the covenant does not obligate it to prevent foreseeable loss of life from climate change_ the committee recalls that the right to life cannot be properly understood if it is interpreted in restrictive manner_ and that the protection of that right requires states parties to adopt positive measures to protect the right to life the committee also recalls its general comment no on the right to life_ in which it established that the right to life also includes the right of individuals to enjoy life with dignity and to be free from acts or omissions that would cause their unnatural or premature death para the committee further recalls that the obligation of states parties to respect and ensure the right to life extends to reasonably foreseeable threats and life threatening situations that can result in loss of life states parties may be in violation of article of the covenant even if such threats and situations do not result in the loss of life the committee considers that such threats may include adverse climate change impacts_ and recalls that environmental degradation_ climate change and unsustainable development constitute some of the most pressing and serious threats to the ability of present and future generations to enjoy the right to life the committee recalls that states parties should take all appropriate measures to address the general conditions in society that may give rise to direct threats to the right to life or prevent individuals from enjoying their right to life with dignity the committee takes note of the state party position that the extension of article of the covenant to right to life with dignity through general comment no is unsupported by the rules of treaty interpretation_ with reference to article of the vienna convention on the law of treaties however_ the committee is of the view that the language at issue is compatible with the latter provision_ which requires that treaty be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose in this regard_ the committee notes that under article of the convention_ the context for interpretation of treaty includes in the first place the text of the treaty_ including its preamble and annexes the preamble of the covenant initially recognizes that the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom_ justice and peace in the world_ and further recognizes that those rights derive from the inherent dignity of the human person while the state party notes that socioeconomic entitlements are protected under separate covenant_ the committee observes that the preamble of the present covenant recognizes that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy their civil and political rights_ as well as their economic_ social and cultural rights the committee observes that both it and regional human rights tribunals have established that environmental degradation can compromise effective enjoyment of the right to life_ and that severe environmental degradation can adversely affect an individual well being and lead to violation of the right to life committee on the elimination of discrimination against women the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women does not make explicit reference to environmental rights however_ in its general recommendation no on the gender related dimensions of disaster risk reduction in the context of climate change_ issued in the committee identified general as well as specific principles of that convention applicable to disaster risk reduction and climate change committee on the rights of the child the committee on the rights of the child the crc dealt with the issue of the effects of climate change on children in general comment no on children rights and the environment_ with special focus on climate change in sacchi and others argentina crc september the crc dealt with complaint lodged by sixteen children of various nationalities against argentina the same complaint was also lodged against brazil_ france_ germany and türkiye the authors claimed to be victims of climate change_ and that the respondent states were responsible for failing to prevent foreseeable human rights violations caused by climate change by reducing their emissions at the highest possible ambition and delaying the steep cuts in carbon emissions needed to protect the lives and welfare of children at home and abroad while the committee established jurisdiction of the respondent states_ it declared the case inadmissible for non exhaustion of domestic remedies for further details_ see duarte agostinho and others portugal and others dec gc no april committee on economic_ social and cultural rights in its statement on climate change and the covenant of october the committee on economic_ social and cultural rights noted as follows the committee welcomes the pledges already made quite apart from such voluntary commitments made under the climate change regime however_ all states have human rights obligations_ that should guide them in the design and implementation of measures to address climate change under the international covenant on economic_ social and cultural rights_ states parties are required to respect_ protect and fulfil all human rights for all they owe such duties not only to their own populations_ but also to populations outside their territories_ consistent with articles and of the united nations charter in doing so they should_ consistent with the covenant_ act on the basis of the best scientific evidence available this committee has already noted that failure to prevent foreseeable human rights harm caused by climate change_ or failure to mobilize the maximum available resources in an effort to do so_ could constitute breach of this obligation the nationally determined contributions ndcs that have been announced until now are insufficient to meet what scientists tell us is required to avoid the most severe impacts of climate change in order to act consistently with their human rights obligations_ the ndcs should be revised to better reflect the highest possible ambition referred to in the paris agreement article the future implementation guidelines of the agreement should require from states that they take into account their human rights duties in the design of the ndcs this implies acting in accordance with the principles of gender sensitivity_ participation_ transparency and accountability and building on local and traditional knowledge moreover_ states parties should adopt measures to adapt to the negative consequences of climate change_ and integrate such measures within existing social_ environmental and budgetary policies at domestic level finally_ as part of their duties of international assistance and cooperation for the realization of human rights_ high income states should also support adaptation efforts_ particularly in developing countries_ by facilitating transfers of green technologies_ and by contributing to the green climate fund this would be consistent with the requirement under the covenant that states ensure the right of everyone to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and with the covenant acknowledgement of the benefits to be derived from the encouragement and development of international contacts and co operation in the scientific field human rights mechanisms have an essential role to play in protecting human rights by ensuring that states avoid taking measures that could accelerate climate change_ and that they dedicate the maximum available resources to the adoption of measures that could mitigate climate change such measures include accelerating the shift to renewable sources of energy such as wind or solar slowing down deforestation and moving to agroecological farming allowing soils to function as carbon sinks improving the insulation of buildings and investing in public transport fundamental shift in the global energy order is urgently required from hydrocarbon to renewable energy sources_ in order to avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system and the significant human rights violations that such interference would cause complying with human rights in the context of climate change is duty of both state and non state actors this requires respecting human rights_ by refraining from the adoption of measures that could worsen climate change protecting human rights_ by effectively regulating private actors to ensure that their actions do not worsen climate change and fulfilling human rights_ by the adoption of policies that can channel modes of production and consumption towards more environmentally sustainable pathway the role of the committee on economic_ social and cultural rights in its future work_ the committee shall continue to keep under review the impacts of climate change on economic_ social and cultural rights_ and provide states guidance as to how they can discharge their duties under the international covenant on economic_ social and cultural rights in the mitigation of climate change and adaptation to its unavoidable effects in the relevant parts of general comment no on science and economic_ social and cultural rights the committee on economic_ social and cultural rights held as follows participation and the precautionary principle participation also includes the right to information and participation in controlling the risks involved in particular scientific processes and its applications in this context_ the precautionary principle plays an important role this principle demands that_ in the absence of full scientific certainty_ when an action or policy may lead to unacceptable harm to the public or the environment_ actions will be taken to avoid or diminish that harm unacceptable harm includes harm to humans or to the environment that is threatening to human life or health serious and effectively irreversible inequitable to present or future generations or imposed without adequate consideration of the human rights of those affected technological and human rights impact assessments are tools that help to identify potential risks early in the process and the use of scientific applications international cooperation fourth_ international cooperation is essential because the most acute risks to the world related to science and technology_ such as climate change_ the rapid loss of biodiversity_ the development of dangerous technologies_ such as autonomous weapons based on artificial intelligence_ or the threat of weapons of mass destruction_ especially nuclear weapons_ are transnational and cannot be adequately addressed without robust international cooperation states should promote multilateral agreements to prevent these risks from materializing or to mitigate their effects the relevant parts of general comment no on the right to health read as follows footnotes omitted the committee interprets the right to health_ as defined in article as an inclusive right extending not only to timely and appropriate health care but also to the underlying determinants of health_ such as access to safe and potable water and adequate sanitation_ an adequate supply of safe food_ nutrition and housing_ healthy occupational and environmental conditions_ and access to health related education and information_ including on sexual and reproductive health further important aspect is the participation of the population in all health related decision making at the community_ national and international levels the improvement of all aspects of environmental and industrial hygiene art comprises_ inter alia_ preventive measures in respect of occupational accidents and diseases the requirement to ensure an adequate supply of safe and potable water and basic sanitation the prevention and reduction of the population exposure to harmful substances such as radiation and harmful chemicals or other detrimental environmental conditions that directly or indirectly impact upon human health the obligation to fulfil requires states parties_ inter alia_ to give sufficient recognition to the right to health in the national political and legal systems_ preferably by way of legislative implementation states are also required to adopt measures against environmental and occupational health hazards and against any other threat as demonstrated by epidemiological data for this purpose they should formulate and implement national policies aimed at reducing and eliminating pollution of air_ water and soil_ including pollution by heavy metals such as lead from gasoline the relevant parts of general comment no on land and economic_ social and cultural rights read as follows climate change the impact of climate change on access to land_ affecting user rights_ is severe in many countries in coastal zones_ sea level rise has an impact on housing_ agriculture and access to fisheries climate change also contributes to land degradation and desertification rising temperatures_ changing patterns of precipitation and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events such as droughts and floods are increasingly affecting access to land states shall cooperate at the international level and comply with their duty to mitigate emissions and their respective commitments made in the context of the implementation of the paris agreement states have these duties also under human rights law_ as the committee has highlighted previously moreover_ states shall avoid adopting policies to mitigate climate change_ such as carbon sequestration through massive reforestation or protection of existing forests_ that lead to different forms of land grabbing_ especially when they affect the land and territories of populations in vulnerable situations_ such as peasants or indigenous peoples mitigation policies should lead to absolute emissions reductions through the phasing out of fossil fuel production and use states have an obligation to design climate change adaptation policies at the national level that take into consideration all forms of land use change induced by climate change_ to register all affected persons and to use the maximum available resources to address the impact of climate change_ particularly on disadvantaged groups climate change affects all countries_ including those that may have contributed to it the least thus_ those countries that have historically contributed most to climate change and those that are currently the main contributors to it shall assist the countries that are most affected by climate change but are least able to cope with its impact_ including by supporting and financing land related adaptation measures cooperation mechanisms for climate change mitigation and adaptation measures shall provide and implement robust set of environmental and social safeguards to ensure that no project negatively affects human rights and the environment and to guarantee access to information and meaningful consultation with those affected by such projects they shall also respect the free_ prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples office of the high commissioner for human rights since presenting general report on the relationship between climate change and human rights to the human rights council in the office of the high commissioner for human rights has submitted several reports to the human rights council focused on the effects of climate change on the enjoyment of human rights of several categories of persons_ including on persons with disabilities women migrants and displaced persons children and on persons suffering from mental health issues in its analytical study on the promotion and protection of the rights of older persons in the context of climate change hrc published in the office of the high commissioner for human rights addressed multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination in relation to climate change_ the relevant parts of which read as follows footnotes omitted both ageing and climate change have differential effects when it comes to gender because women tend to live longer_ there are more older women than older men_ and women in heterosexual partnerships tend to outlive their partners_ so more older women live alone physiological and physical differences_ social norms and roles_ and gender discrimination and inequities in access to resources and power all play role in making older women face particular risk of vulnerability to climate impacts older women experience higher rates of poverty than older men and face other economic hardships that are aggravated by climate change they also face health risks_ including greater likelihood of experiencing chronic diseases and air pollution harms_ and have higher rates of mortality and other health complications from extreme heat events than any other demographic group conversely_ during typhoons_ older men have been found to be more at risk of death gendered social roles and expectations have complex effects on climate risks for older people in some societies_ older men are more socially isolated and thus have more difficulty in accessing assistance to cope with the negative effects of climate change however_ in situations of emergency or strained family resources brought on by climate impacts_ older women are sometimes more likely to be viewed as burden and to suffer abuse or neglect in some countries_ older women are blamed for extreme weather through accusations of witchcraft or sorcery_ and face violence or exclusion as result transformation of traditional livelihoods and of cultural and social practices also has varying effects on men and women because of their different social roles social norms around gender orientation and sexual identity may also compound the negative human rights

committee on economic_ social and cultural rights committee on the protection of the rights of all migrant workers and members of their families committee on the rights of the child and committee on the rights of persons with disabilities issued joint statement on human rights and climate change the relevant parts of which provide as follows footnotes omitted the report released in by the panel on climate change on global warming of oc above pre industrial levels confirms that climate change poses significant risks to the enjoyment of the human rights protected by the international convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women_ the international covenant on economic_ social and cultural rights_ the international convention on the protection of the rights of all migrant workers and members of their families_ the convention on the rights of the child_ and the international convention on the rights of persons with disabilities the adverse impacts identified in the report threaten_ among others_ the right to life_ the right to adequate food_ the right to adequate housing_ to health and to water_ and cultural rights these negative impacts are also illustrated in the damage suffered by the ecosystems which in turn affect the enjoyment of human rights the risk of harm is particularly high for those segments of the population already marginalized or in vulnerable situations or that_ owing to discrimination and pre existing inequalities_ have limited access to decision making or resources_ such as women_ children_ persons with disabilities_ indigenous peoples and persons living in rural areas children are at particularly heightened risk of harm to their health_ owing to the immaturity of their body systems states human

of persons with disabilities_ states parties have obligations_ including obligations_ to respect_ protect and fulfil all human rights of all peoples failure to take measures to prevent foreseeable harm to human rights caused by climate change_ or to regulate activities contributing to such harm_ could constitute violation of states human rights obligations in order for states to comply with their human rights obligations_ and to realize the objectives of the paris agreement_ they must adopt and implement policies aimed at reducing emissions these policies must reflect the highest possible ambition_ foster climate resilience and ensure that public and private investments are consistent with pathway towards low carbon emissions and climate resilient development in their efforts to reduce emissions_ states parties should contribute effectively to phasing out fossils fuels_ promoting renewable energy and addressing emissions from the land sector_ including by combating deforestation additionally_ states must regulate private actors_ including by holding them accountable for harm they generate both domestically and states should also discontinue financial incentives or investments in activities and infrastructure which are not consistent with low ghg emissions pathways_ whether undertaken by public or private actors as mitigation measure to prevent further damage and risk when reducing emissions and adapting to climate impacts_ states must seek to address all forms of discrimination and inequality_ including advancing substantive gender equality_ protecting the rights of indigenous peoples and of persons with disabilities_ and taking into consideration the best interests of the child role of the committees in their future work_ the committees shall continue to keep under review the impacts of climate change and climate induced disasters on the rights holders protected under their respective treaties they will also continue to provide states parties with guidance on how they can meet their obligations under these instruments in relation to mitigation and adaptation to climate change on december the international tribunal for the law of the sea received request from the commission of small island states on climate change and international law to deliver an advisory opinion on the scope and content of the specific obligations of states parties to the united nations convention on the law of the sea unclos including under part xii thereof the questions put in the request were the following what are the specific obligations of state parties to the united nations convention on the law of the sea unclos including under part xii to prevent_ reduce and control pollution of the marine environment in relation to the deleterious effects that result or are likely to result from climate change_ including through ocean warming and sea level rise_ and ocean acidification_ which are caused by anthropogenic ghg emissions into the atmosphere to protect and preserve the marine environment in relation to climate change impacts_ including ocean warming and sea level rise_ and ocean acidification on march under article of the charter of the united nations_ the un general assembly adopted resolution requesting the international court of justice to provide an advisory opinion on states obligations in respect of climate change the questions put to that court were the following having particular regard to the charter of the united nations_ the international covenant on civil and political rights_ the international covenant on economic_ social and cultural rights_ the united nations framework convention on climate change_ the paris agreement_ the united nations convention on the law of the sea_ the duty of due diligence_ the rights recognized in the universal declaration of human rights_ the principle of prevention of significant harm to the environment and the duty to protect and preserve the marine environment_ what are the obligations of states under international law to ensure the protection of the climate system and other parts of the environment from anthropogenic emissions of ghg for states and for present and future generations what are the legal consequences under these obligations for states where they_ by their acts and omissions_ have caused significant harm to the climate system and other parts of the environment_ with respect to states_ including_ in particular_ small island developing states_ which due to their geographical circumstances and level of development_ are injured or specially affected by or are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change ii peoples and individuals of the present and future generations affected by the adverse effects of climate change council of assembly of the council of europe in recommendation adopted on september entitled anchoring the right to healthy environment need for enhanced action by the council of europe the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe pace recommended that the committee of ministers draw up an additional protocol to the european convention on human rights and an additional protocol to the european social charter on the right to safe_ clean_ healthy and sustainable environment_ based on the terminology used by the united nations more generally_ in resolution similarly entitled_ pace recommended that the member states build and consolidate legal framework domestically and at european level to anchor the right to safe_ clean_ healthy and sustainable environment_ based on the united nations guidance on this matter the relevant part of the resolution reads as follows the parliamentary assembly notes that already in the stockholm declaration of the united nations conference on the human environment explicitly linked environmental protection and first generation human rights_ indirectly referring to the right to healthy environment since then_ about half the countries of the world have recognised the right to healthy environment in their constitutions_ including council of europe member states the right to healthy environment is also recognised through series of regional agreements and arrangements worldwide with the exception of the european region the assembly believes that the european vision of contemporary human rights protection could nevertheless become benchmark for ecological human rights in the st century_ if action is taken now so far this vision has been limited to civil and political rights enshrined in the european convention on human rights and its protocols ets no hereafter the convention and socio economic rights recognised in the european social charter ets nos and hereafter the charter the assembly notes that the convention does not make any specific reference to the protection of the environment_ and the european court of human rights hereafter the court can thus not deal effectively enough with this new generation human right the assembly call for action_ in particular in recommendation drafting an additional protocol to the european convention on human rights concerning the right to healthy environment was unfortunately not followed by the committee of ministers the court case law provides for indirect protection of right to the environment by sanctioning only environmental violations that simultaneously result in an infringement of other human rights already recognised in the convention the court thus favours an anthropocentric and utilitarian approach to the environment which prevents natural elements from being afforded any protection per se the assembly encourages the council of europe to recognise_ in time_ the intrinsic value of nature and ecosystems in the light of the between human societies and nature the assembly is convinced that the council of europe as the european continent leading human rights and rule of law organisation should stay proactive in the evolution of human rights and adapt its legal framework accordingly legally binding and enforceable instrument_ such as an additional protocol to the convention_ would finally give the court non disputable base for rulings concerning human rights violations arising from environment related adverse impacts on human health_ dignity and life the assembly considers that an explicit recognition of right to healthy and viable environment would be an incentive for stronger domestic environmental laws and more protection focused approach by the court it would make it easier for victims to lodge applications for remedies and would also act as preventive mechanism to supplement the currently rather reactive case law of the court recognising an autonomous right to healthy environment would have the benefit of allowing violation to be found irrespective of whether another right had been breached and would therefore raise the profile of this right in this context_ the assembly notes that the united nations un in its studies and resolutions on human rights and the environment_ mainly refers to the human rights obligations linked to the enjoyment of safe_ clean_ healthy and sustainable environment the council of europe should be encouraged to use this terminology for its own legal instruments though it may want to go even further and guarantee the right to decent or ecologically viable environment in recommendation pace recommended that the committee of ministers draw up an additional protocol to the european convention on human rights on the right to safe_ clean_ healthy and sustainable environment the relevant part of the recommendation reads as follows the parliamentary assembly refers to its resolution anchoring the right to healthy environment need for enhanced action by the council of europe and reiterates the need for the council of europe to modernise its standard setting activity so as to embrace the new generation of human rights the assembly is highly concerned by the speed and extent of environmental degradation_ loss of biodiversity_ and the climate crisis that directly impact on human health_ dignity and life it considers that it is high time for the council of europe to show ambition and strategic vision for the future by facing up to this major transformative challenge for human rights and securing their enhanced protection in the era of systemic environmental threats to the present and future generations the assembly notes that harmful environmental impacts are increasingly affecting the enjoyment of first and second generation human rights by individuals and society at large_ hurting the shared values that the council of europe is called upon to defend those impacts are being recognised through environmental litigation at national level across europe and beyond they constitute compelling case for consolidating and updating the council of europe legal arsenal_ and linking up national action with commitments under the relevant international treaties_ such as the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc and the paris agreement to this end_ the assembly recommends that the committee of ministers draw up an additional protocol to the european convention on human rights ets no hereafter the convention on the right to safe_ clean_ healthy and sustainable environment_ based on the terminology used by the united nations and drawing on the text reproduced below_ which is an integral part of this recommendation the inclusion of this right in the convention would establish the clear responsibility of member states to maintain good state of the environment that is compatible with life in dignity and good health and the full enjoyment of other fundamental rights this would also support much more effective protection of safe_ clean_ healthy and sustainable environment at national level_ including for generations to come draw up an additional protocol to the european social charter ets nos and hereafter the charter on the right to safe_ clean_ healthy and sustainable environment the inclusion of this right in the esc would make it possible to recognise the between protection of social rights and environmental protection it would also enable non governmental organisations to lodge collective complaints on environmental issues launch the preparation of feasibility study for convention on environmental threats and technological hazards threatening human health_ dignity and life the drawing up of such convention would afford an opportunity to incorporate therein the principles of prevention_ precaution and non regression_ which are necessary if humanity right to healthy environment is to be properly protected the convention could also include supranational monitoring mechanism modelled on independent expert committees such as the group of experts on action against trafficking in human beings greta and the group of experts on action against violence against women and domestic violence grevio revise recommendation cm rec on human rights and business with view to strengthening corporate environmental responsibility for the adequate protection of the human right to safe_ clean_ healthy and sustainable environment pace also adopted recommendation and resolution entitled the climate crisis and the rule of law in the latter_ it referred to the court case law in relation to environmental damage in particular_ it urged the member states to do the following promote the rule of law and employ transparent_ accountable and democratic legislative process for implementing the aim of net zero emissions based on clear and credible plans to meet commitments to keep the global temperature increase in line with the preferred objective of the paris agreement_ amounting to an increase in average temperatures of oc committee of ministers the committee of ministers issued replies to the above mentioned recommendations of the parliamentary assembly in reply issued on october it addressed the recommendation to adopt new protocol to the european convention on human rights_ indicating that it had instructed the steering committee for human rights cddh to undertake other possible work_ including the preparation of study on the need for and feasibility of further instrument or instruments on human rights and the environment the committee of ministers adopted its recommendation cm rec to member states on human rights and the protection of the environment on september in the preamble_ the committee of ministers noted the increased recognition of some form of the right to clean_ healthy and sustainable environment in_ inter alia_ international instruments_ including regional human rights instruments_ and national constitutions_ legislation and policies the committee of ministers then recommended that the member states undertake the following reflect on the nature_ content and implications of the right to clean_ healthy and sustainable environment and_ on that basis_ actively consider recognising at the national level this right as human right that is important for the enjoyment of human rights and is related to other rights and existing international law review their national legislation and practice in order to ensure that they are consistent with the principles and guidance set out in the appendix to this recommendation the appendix to this recommendation_ containing six paragraphs_ reads as follows in the implementation of this recommendation_ member states should ensure the respect of general principles of international environmental law_ such as the no harm principle_ the principle of prevention_ the principle of precaution and the polluter pays principle_ and take into account the need for equity member states should ensure_ without discrimination_ the effective enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms and_ when applicable_ the european social charter and the european social charter revised including in relation to the environment member states should take adequate measures to protect the rights of those who are most vulnerable to_ or at particular risk from_ environmental harm_ taking into account their needs_ risks and capacities member states should ensure access without discrimination_ inter alia_ to information and justice in environmental matters_ participation in environmental decision making and environmental education member states should ensure that human rights are taken into account at all stages of the environmental decision making process taking into consideration their vital role in the protection of the environment_ member states should consult and co operate in the implementation of this recommendation with sub national entities_ civil society_ national human rights institutions_ regional institutions for the protection and promotion of human rights_ environmental human rights defenders_ economic stakeholders_ indigenous peoples and local communities_ cities and regions member states should encourage or_ where appropriate_ require business enterprises to act in compliance with their human rights related to the environment_ including by applying smart mix of measures national and international_ mandatory and voluntary in the explanatory memorandum to the recommendation the cddh stated that the recommendation in question did not have any effect on the legal nature of the instruments on which it was based_ or on the extent of states existing legal obligations nor did it seek to establish new standards or obligations council of europe commissioner for human rights in the human rights comment living in clean environment neglected human rights concern for all of us the commissioner stressed as follows the council of europe bodies overseeing the implementation of the european convention of human rights and the european social charter have produced an extensive body of case law that delineates states parties obligations in the field of the environment despite the absence in the convention of specific reference to the environment_ the european court of human rights has clearly established that various types of environmental degradation can result in violations of substantive human rights_ such as the right to life_ to private and family life_ the prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment_ and the peaceful enjoyment of the home moreover_ the european committee of social rights has interpreted the right to health included in the charter to encompass the right to healthy environment states must adopt and adhere to ambitious_ holistic policies and measures to preserve the environment and biodiversity_ combat air_ water and soil pollution_ mitigate climate change and ensure proper waste disposal in doing so_ they should pay extra attention to protect the rights of those most vulnerable_ including children_ the poor and marginalised communities who tend to be affected by environmental degradation rather than piecemeal approach that merely reacts to individual complaints_ what is needed is preventive approach at national and local level grounded in the human rights standards of the council of europe this also means ensuring that environmental policies are accompanied by measures to protect the rights of those they may impact_ including the right to work and to an adequate standard of living of those working in mining or heavy industries_ for example it is extremely important for states to educate people from an early age of the need to preserve the environment and teach them how to do so further_ states must ensure people rights to information_ participation and redress_ and demonstrate their commitment to doing so by ratifying the aarhus convention other materials in the european commission for democracy through law the venice commission addressed the question of judicial control in the field of environmental protection the venice commission is aware of the problems of judicial control in the area of protection of the environment critics or sceptics will claim that this area is not suitable for judicial control_ as it will take the courts into sophisticated discussions on natural sciences they might also claim that as the environmental protection is an area for discretion and political compromises_ in case parliament or government made political compromise on the protection of the environment_ the judicial branch should not intervene however_ an important argument to counter such conclusion is that the protection of the environment is not like the traditional human rights conflict_ where the minority needs protection against the majority in the area of protection of the environment_ there is totally new dimension the protection of the rights of future generations as the future generations do not take part in present day democracy and do not vote in present day elections_ the judicial branch appears to be best placed to protect the future generations against the decisions of present day politicians in appendix of the reykjavík declaration the following was declared we_ the heads of state and government_ underline the urgency of taking co ordinated action to protect the environment by countering the triple planetary crisis of pollution_ climate change and loss of biodiversity we affirm that human rights and the environment are intertwined and that clean_ healthy and sustainable environment is integral to the full enjoyment of human rights by present and future generations we note that the right to healthy environment is enshrined in various ways in several constitutions of the council of europe member states and the increased recognition of the right to clean_ healthy and sustainable environment in_ inter alia_ international instruments_ regional human rights instruments_ national constitutions_ legislation and policies we recall the extensive case law and practice on environment and human rights developed by the european court of human rights and the european committee of social rights we appreciate the ongoing work of the committee of ministers_ the parliamentary assembly_ the congress of local and regional authorities of the council of europe_ the commissioner for human rights_ the youth sector and other parts of the council of europe to strengthen the protection of human rights linked to the protection of the environment together we commit to strengthening our work at the council of europe on the human rights aspects of the environment based on the political recognition of the right to clean_ healthy and sustainable environment as human right_ in line with united nations general assembly resolution the human right to clean_ healthy and sustainable environment and by pursuing the implementation of committee of ministers recommendation cm rec on human rights and the protection of the environment initiating the reykjavík process of strengthening the work of the council of europe in this field_ with the aim of making the environment visible priority for the organisation the process will focus and streamline the organisation activities_ with view to promoting co operation among member states we will identify the challenges raised by the triple planetary

where applicable_ and shall provide further evidence thereof upon request case law of the court of justice and the general court of the european union in the european commission adopted decision granting spain financial assistance from the european regional development fund for the construction of two power stations in the canary islands in greenpeace brought an action before the court of first instance the cfi now the general court seeking annulment of the commission decision to disburse these funds to spain_ and of another decision which the commission had allegedly subsequently taken to reimburse further expenses incurred in the construction of the power stations in the cfi dismissed the annulment action of the applicant association for lack of standing on appeal_ the applicant association argued_ on the one hand_ that by applying case law on standing developed by the court of justice of the european union cjeu in relation to economic issues_ the cfi had failed to take account of the nature and specific character of the environmental interests underpinning their action and_ on the other_ that the approach adopted by the cfi had created legal vacuum in ensuring compliance with community environmental legislation_ since in this area the interests were by their very nature_ common and shared_ and the rights relating to those interests were liable to be held by potentially large number of individuals so that there could never be closed class of applicants satisfying the criteria adopted by the cfi judgment of the cjeu of april in stichting greenpeace council greenpeace international and others commission_ p_ eu paragraphs in reply_ the cjeu held as follows ibid paragraphs and the interpretation of the fourth paragraph of article of the treaty now article tfeu that the cfi applied in concluding that the appellants did not have locus standi is consonant with the settled case law of the court of justice as far as natural persons are concerned_ it follows from the case law that where_ as in the present case_ the specific situation of the applicant was not taken into consideration in the adoption of the act_ which concerns him in general and abstract fashion and_ in fact_ like any other person in the same situation_ the applicant is not individually concerned by the act the same applies to associations which claim to have locus standi on the basis of the fact that the persons whom they represent are individually concerned by the contested decision for the reasons given in the preceding paragraph_ that is not the case in appraising the appellants arguments purporting to demonstrate that the case law of the court of justice_ as applied by the cfi takes no account of the nature and specific characteristics of the environmental interests underpinning their action_ it should be emphasised that it is the decision to build the two power stations in question which is liable to affect the environmental rights arising under directive that the appellants seek to invoke in the circumstances of the present case those rights are fully protected by the national courts which may_ if need be_ refer question to this court for preliminary ruling under article of the treaty now article tfeu this line of reasoning_ on the strict requirements for natural and legal persons to have standing to institute annulment actions_ was confirmed by the cjeu in its judgment of july in unión de pequeños agricultores council of the european union_ p_ eu paragraphs by article and article now article and article tfeu on the one hand_ and by article now article tfeu on the other_ the treaty has established complete system of legal remedies and procedures designed to ensure judicial review of the legality of acts of the institutions_ and has entrusted such review to the community courts see_ to that effect_ les verts parliament_ paragraph under that system_ where natural or legal persons cannot_ by reason of the conditions for admissibility laid down in the fourth paragraph of article of the treaty now article tfeu directly challenge community measures of general application_ they are able_ depending on the case_ either indirectly to plead the invalidity of such acts before the community courts under article of the treaty now article tfeu or to do so before the national courts and ask them_ since they have no jurisdiction themselves to declare those measures invalid see case foto frost ecr paragraph to make reference to the court of justice for preliminary ruling on validity thus_ it is for the member states to establish system of legal remedies and procedures which ensure respect for the right to effective judicial protection in two annulment actions concerning climate change were rejected by the cjeu in one case the applicants sought the annulment of the legislative package relating to ghg emissions armando carvalho and others while in the other the applicants sought the annulment of part of directive eu of december on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources peter sabo and others the cjeu_ referring to its well established case law in relation to article of the treaty on the functioning of the european union tfeu oj on the standing of natural and legal persons to bring actions for annulment_ confirmed that the latter had to be able to demonstrate that they were individually concerned by the impugned acts condition not fulfilled by the applicants in either of those cases the relevant parts of the judgment of the cjeu in armando carvalho and others_ which was decided by chamber of three judges_ read as follows the general court held_ in essence that the fact that the effects of climate change may be different for one person than they are for another and that they depend on the personal circumstances specific to each person does not mean that the acts at issue distinguish each of the appellants individually in other words_ the fact that the appellants_ owing to the alleged circumstances_ are affected differently by climate change is not in itself sufficient to establish the standing of those appellants to bring an action for annulment of measure of general application such as the acts at issue accordingly_ the general court held_ in paragraph of the order under appeal_ that the appellants interpretation of the circumstances alleged by them as establishing that they were individually concerned would render the requirements of the fourth paragraph of article tfeu meaningless and would create locus standi for all without the criterion of individual concern referred to in the judgment in plaumann being fulfilled consequently_ the appellants cannot claim that the general court did not take into account_ in the order under appeal_ the characteristics specific to them in order to determine whether they were individually concerned moreover_ the appellants argument that the general court made no reference_ in the order under appeal_ to the evidence showing that the appellants were affected in different ways by climate change is_ in the light of the foregoing_ ineffective according to settled case law_ which has not been altered by the treaty of lisbon_ natural or legal persons satisfy the condition of individual concern only if the contested act affects them by reason of certain attributes which are peculiar to them or by reason of circumstances in which they are differentiated from all other persons_ and by virtue of these factors distinguishes them individually just as in the case of the person addressed judgment of october inuit tapiriit kanatami and others parliament and council_ p_ eu paragraphs and and the case law cited in that regard_ as is noted by the parliament_ the appellants reasoning_ in addition to its generic wording_ leads to the conclusion that there is locus standi for any applicant_ since fundamental right is always likely to be concerned in one way or another by measures of general application such as those contested in the present case as was recalled by the general court in paragraph of the order under appeal_ the claim that the acts at issue infringe fundamental rights is not sufficient in itself to establish that the action brought by an individual is admissible_ without running the risk of rendering the requirements of the fourth paragraph of article tfeu meaningless see_ to that effect_ orders of may fnab and others council_ p_ eu paragraph and of january sabo and others parliament and council_ p_ not published_ eu paragraph and the case law cited since_ as is apparent from paragraph of the order under appeal_ the appellants merely invoked_ before the general court_ an infringement of their fundamental rights_ inferring individual concern from that infringement_ on the ground that the effects of climate change and_ accordingly_ the infringement of fundamental rights are unique to and different for each individual_ it cannot be held that the acts at issue affect the appellants by reason of certain attributes which are peculiar to them or by reason of circumstances in which they are differentiated from all other persons_ and by virtue of these factors distinguish them individually just as in the case of the person addressed therefore_ the general court was fully entitled to hold_ in paragraph of the order under appeal_ that the appellants had not established that the contested provisions of the acts at issue distinguished them individually from all other natural or legal persons concerned by those provisions just as in the case of the addressee referring to the fact that_ under eu law_ actions for annulment by associations had been held to be admissible where_ inter alia_ the association represented the interests of its members_ who would themselves be entitled to bring proceedings_ the cjeu held as follows ibid indeed_ in so far as the appellants_ as natural persons_ were considered not to be individually concerned for the purposes of the fourth paragraph of article tfeu_ the same consideration applies to the members of that association those members cannot therefore claim that they possess attributes which distinguish them individually from the other potential addressees of the acts at issue concerning the first condition_ it should be borne in mind that associations have right to bring proceedings against an act of the union where the provisions of eu law specifically recognise those associations as having procedural rights see_ to that effect_ judgment of october fediol commission_ eu paragraph however_ the association sáminuorra has not claimed that such provisions exist in its favour as regards the argument that the general court should have recognised the existence of another situation in which associations would be entitled to bring proceedings_ namely the action of collective defending collective good that argument was not put forward at first instance and must therefore_ pursuant to article of the rules of procedure of the court of justice_ be rejected as inadmissible in the context of the present appeal to allow the appellants to raise for the first time before the court of justice arguments which they have not raised before the general court would be to authorise them to bring before the court of justice_ whose jurisdiction in appeals is limited_ case of wider ambit than that which came before the general court in an appeal_ the jurisdiction of the court of justice is thus confined to review of the findings of law on the pleas argued before the lower court see_ to that effect_ judgment of june lafarge commission_ p_ eu paragraph in the case of peter sabo and others_ the cjeu also held as follows he claim that an act infringes fundamental rights is not sufficient in itself for it to be established that the action brought by an individual is admissible_ without running the risk of rendering the requirements of the fourth paragraph of article tfeu meaningless indeed_ it is apparent from the settled case law of the court that the extent of the alleged adverse impact on the observance of the appellants fundamental rights cannot give rise to non application of the rules for admissibility expressly laid down by the fourth paragraph of article tfeu the cjeu also has extensive case law on the aarhus convention_ which the eu ratified in following which various pieces of eu legislation were enacted_ including the aarhus regulation regulation more recently_ in the context of request for preliminary ruling under article tfeu_ the scope and content of obligations under article of the aarhus convention access to justice were examined in relation to eu rules regarding emissions from motor vehicles in the judgment of november of the cjeu grand chamber in deutsche umwelthilfe ev bundesrepublik deutschland the relevant parts of the reasoning provide as follows article of the convention on access to information_ public participation in decision making and access to justice in environmental matters_ signed in aarhus on june and approved on behalf of the european community by council decision ec of february read in conjunction with article of the charter of fundamental rights of the european union_ must be interpreted as precluding situation where an environmental association_ authorised to bring legal proceedings in accordance with national law_ is unable to challenge before national court an administrative decision granting or amending ec type approval which may be contrary to article of regulation ec no of the european parliament and of the council of june on type approval of motor vehicles with respect to emissions from light passenger and commercial vehicles euro and euro and on access to vehicle repair and maintenance information secondly_ where member state lays down rules of procedural law applicable to the matters referred to in article of the aarhus convention concerning the exercise of the rights that an environmental organisation derives from article of regulation no in order for decisions of the competent national authorities to be reviewed in the light of their obligations under that article_ the member state is implementing eu law for the purposes of article of the charter and must_ therefore_ ensure compliance_ inter alia_ with the right to an effective remedy_ enshrined in article thereof see_ to that effect_ judgment of december protect natur arten und eu paragraphs and and the case law cited consequently_ while it is true that article of the aarhus convention does not have direct effect in eu law and cannot_ therefore_ be relied on_ as such_ in dispute falling within the scope of eu law_ in order to disapply provision of national law which is contrary to it_ the fact remains that_ first_ the primacy of international agreements concluded by the european union requires that national law be interpreted_ to the fullest extent possible_ in accordance with the requirements of those agreements and_ secondly_ that article of the aarhus convention_ read in conjunction with article of the charter_ imposes on member states an obligation to ensure effective judicial protection of the rights conferred by eu law_ in particular the provisions of environmental law judgment of december protect natur arten und eu paragraph however_ the right to bring proceedings provided for in article of the aarhus convention_ which is intended to ensure effective environmental protection judgment of march lesoochranárske zoskupenie_ eu paragraph would be deprived of all useful effect_ and even of its very substance_ if it had to be conceded that_ by imposing criteria laid down by national law_ certain categories of members of the public fortiori the public concerned such as environmental associations that satisfy the requirements laid down in article of the aarhus convention were to be denied of any right to bring proceedings against acts and omissions by private persons and public authorities which contravene certain categories of provisions of national law relating to the environment see_ to that effect_ judgment of december protect natur arten und eu paragraph imposing those criteria must not deprive environmental associations in particular of the possibility of verifying that the rules of eu environmental law are being complied with_ given also that such rules are usually in the public interest_ rather than simply in the interests of certain individuals_ and that the objective of those associations is to defend the public interest judgment of december protect natur arten und eu paragraph and the case law cited material from other regional human rights mechanismsinter american system relevant instruments the american convention on human rights does not contain any specific provision relating to the protection of human right to healthy environment however_ the additional protocol to the american convention on human rights in the area of economic_ social and cultural rights provides as follows article right to healthy environment everyone shall have the right to live in healthy environment and to have access to basic public services the states parties shall promote the protection_ preservation_ and improvement of the environment the inter american convention on protecting the human rights of older persons provides the following article right to healthy environment older persons have the right to live in healthy environment with access to basic public services to that end_ states parties shall adopt appropriate measures to safeguard and promote the exercise of this right_ inter alia to foster the development of older persons to their full potential in harmony with nature to ensure access for older persons_ on an equal basis with others_ to basic public drinking water and sanitation services_ among others the inter american court of human rights on november the inter american court of human rights delivered an advisory opinion entitled the environment and human rights in which it derived the right to healthy environment from article of the american convention economic_ social_ and cultural rights the relevant concluding part of the advisory opinion reads as follows conclusion based on the above_ in response to the second and third questions of the requesting state_ it is the court opinion that_ in order to respect and to ensure the rights to life and to personal integrity states have the obligation to prevent significant environmental damage within or outside their territory_ in accordance with paragraphs to of this opinion to comply with the obligation of prevention_ states must regulate_ supervise and monitor the activities within their jurisdiction that could produce significant environmental damage conduct environmental impact assessments when there is risk of significant environmental damage prepare contingency plan to establish safety measures and procedures to minimize the possibility of major environmental accidents_ and mitigate any significant environmental damage that may have occurred_ even when it has happened despite the state preventive actions_ in accordance with paragraph to of this opinion states must act in keeping with the precautionary principle in order to protect the rights to life and to personal integrity in the case of potential serious or irreversible damage to the environment_ even in the absence of scientific certainty_ in accordance with paragraph of this opinion states have the obligation to cooperate_ in good faith_ to protect against environmental damage_ in accordance with paragraphs to of this opinion to comply with the obligation of cooperation_ states must notify other potentially affected states when they become aware that an activity planned under their jurisdiction could result in risk of significant transboundary harm and also in cases of environmental emergencies_ and consult and negotiate in good faith with states potentially affected by significant transboundary harm_ in accordance with paragraphs to of this opinion states have the obligation to ensure the right of access to information_ established in article of the american convention_ concerning potential environmental impacts_ in accordance with paragraphs to of this opinion states have the obligation to ensure the right to public participation of the persons subject to their jurisdiction established in article of the american convention_ in policies and decision making that could affect the environment_ in accordance with paragraphs to of this opinion_ andh states have the obligation to ensure access to justice in relation to the state obligations with regard to protection of the environment set out in this opinion_ in accordance with paragraphs to of this opinion the obligations described above have been developed in relation to the general obligations to respect and to ensure the rights to life and to personal integrity_ because these were the rights that the state referred to in its request supra paras and however_ this does not mean that the said obligations do not exist with regard to the other rights mentioned in this opinion as being particularly vulnerable in the case of environmental degradation supra paras to in the case of the indigenous communities of the lhaka honhat association our land argentina the inter american court of human rights held argentina responsible for violating indigenous communities human rights through its failure to recognise and protect their lands in that case_ the court examined the rights to healthy environment_ adequate food_ water_ and cultural identity autonomously in january new request for an advisory opinion was submitted to the inter american court of human rights by colombia and chile asking it to clarify the scope of state obligations_ in their individual and collective dimension_ in order to respond to the climate emergency within the framework of international human rights law_ paying special attention to the differentiated impacts of this emergency on individuals from diverse regions and population groups_ as well as on nature and on human survival on the planet the inter american commission on human rights in march the inter american commission on human rights and the office of the special rapporteur on economic_ social_ cultural and environmental rights published resolution recognising that climate change was human rights emergency african system the relevant part of the african charter on human and peoples rights reads as follows article all people shall have the right to general satisfactory environment favourable to their development on may the african commission on human and peoples rights adopted resolution on the human rights impacts of extreme weather in eastern and southern africa due to climate change in which it addressed the implications of climate change on human rights in the case of social and economic action rights centre nigeria the african commission held as follows footnotes omitted the complainants allege that the nigerian government violated the right to health and the right to clean environment as recognized under articles and of the african charter these rights recognise the importance of clean and safe environment that is closely linked to economic and social rights in so far as the environment affects the quality of life and safety of the individual as has been rightly observed by alexander kiss_ an environment degraded by pollution and defaced by the destruction of all beauty and variety is as contrary to satisfactory living conditions and the development as the breakdown of the fundamental ecologic equilibria is harmful to physical and moral health the right to general satisfactory environment_ as guaranteed under article of the african charter or the right to healthy environment_ as it is widely known_ therefore imposes clear obligations upon government it requires the state to take reasonable and other measures to prevent pollution and ecological degradation_ to promote conservation_ and to secure an ecologically sustainable development and use of natural resources article of the international covenant on economic_ social and cultural rights icescr to which nigeria is party_ requires governments to take necessary steps for the improvement of all aspects of environmental and industrial hygiene the right to enjoy the best attainable state of physical and mental health enunciated in article of the african charter and the right to general satisfactory environment favourable to development article already noted obligate governments to desist from directly threatening the health and environment of their citizens the state is under an obligation to respect the just noted rights and this entails largely non interventionist conduct from the state for example_ not from carrying out_ sponsoring or tolerating any practice_ policy or legal measures violating the integrity of the individual government compliance with the spirit of articles and of the african charter must also include ordering or at least permitting independent scientific monitoring of threatened environments_ requiring and publicising environmental and social impact studies prior to any major industrial development_ undertaking appropriate monitoring and providing information to those communities exposed to hazardous materials and activities and providing meaningful opportunities for individuals to be heard and to participate in the development decisions affecting their communities the uniqueness of the african situation and the special qualities of the african charter on human and peoples rights imposes upon the african commission an important task international law and human rights must be responsive to african circumstances clearly_ collective rights_ environmental rights_ and economic and social rights are essential elements of human rights in africa the african commission will apply any of the diverse rights contained in the african charter it welcomes this opportunity to make clear that there is no right in the african charter that cannot be made effective as indicated in the preceding paragraphs_ however_ the nigerian government did not live up to the minimum expectations of the african charter comparative lawrelevant comparative materials concerning the aarhus convention of the forty six council of europe member states only five have not ratified the aarhus convention in great majority of the thirty eight member states surveyed by the court environmental non governmental associations are allowed to bring cases in the interests of the protection of the environment and or in the interests of private individuals who may be affected by specific environmental hazards or industrial projects in at least thirty four states however_ the non governmental association in question has to fulfil certain criteria in almost all the member states surveyed_ the corporate goals of the association have to be linked to the interests it seeks to protect in eleven member states such associations have to have existed_ or to have been actively involved in the protection of the environment_ for some time before bringing case_ and in eight member states the association bringing case has to operate in particular geographical zone some member states provide for additional criteria for recognising the standing of associations_ but these are less common the size of the association prior participation in the decision making process internal organisation prohibition for the association or its leadership to participate in for profit activities and general requirement of the lawfulness of the activities of the association moreover_ in some systems the question of the standing of the association may depend on the question of the standing of natural persons who may be directly affected by the environmental hazards the standing of the association may be established directly by the court or_ in six member states_ through mechanism of preliminary accreditation by an administrative authority as to climate change cases_ in most member states_ it appears that while theoretical possibility of an environmental association bringing climate change case may exist_ or cannot be ruled out_ there is no conclusive case law on the matter_ or no case law at all in seven member states such claims by an environmental association would probably not be acceptable in the national legal order_ while in five others possibility for an environmental association to bring legal cases concerning climate change_ under certain conditions linked to the actionability of the claim has been examined by domestic courts belgium_ france_ germany_ ireland and the netherlands overview of domestic case law concerning climate change the following overview of domestic case law provides extracts from some cases on climate change brought before national courts in council of europe member states france the grande synthe case the detailed circumstances of the grande synthe case of the conseil état are set out in the case of carême france dec gc no april in that case_ upon an action brought by mr carême acting on his own behalf and in his capacity as mayor of grande synthe_ and in the name and on behalf of the latter municipality_ the conseil état declared admissible the action brought by the municipality and inadmissible the action brought by mr carême the conseil état found that the measures taken by the authorities to tackle climate change had not been sufficient and ordered the authorities to take additional measures by march to meet the ghg emissions reduction targets set out in the domestic legislation and annex of regulation eu applications for judicial review seeking to secure compliance with the limit values for concentrations of particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide by decision of july the conseil état_ on an application for judicial review_ set aside the tacit refusals of the president of the republic_ the prime minister and the ministers responsible for the environment and health and ordered the prime minister and the minister responsible for the environment to take all appropriate measures before march and to draw up plans in accordance with article of directive ec of may in order to reduce the concentrations of particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide throughout the national territory conseil état plenary july association les amis de la terre france et autres_ no referring in particular to the limit values for concentrations of particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide laid down by the directive of the european parliament and of the council of may on ambient air quality and cleaner air for europe and to the fact that_ in certain areas of french territory_ those values had been exceeded each year between and the conseil état found that the regulatory authority had failed to fulfil its obligations by omitting to draw up air quality plans for the areas concerned in accordance with the provisions of the directive and those transposing the directive into domestic law the conseil état stated in that judgment that the setting aside of the decisions tacitly refusing to take action necessarily entailed taking all the measures necessary to ensure that the appropriate air quality plans were drawn up and implemented full administrative law actions seeking to secure compliance with ghg emissions reduction targets in another more recent case_ known as the case of the century which concerned ghg emissions reduction targets_ the paris administrative court_ drawing on the grande synthe case_ acknowledged_ this time in the context of full administrative law action and in judgment of february that environmental associations were justified in arguing that_ to the extent that the state had made commitments which it had not complied with in the context of the first carbon budget_ it should be regarded as liable for part of the ecological damage within the meaning of article of the civil code that article_ as amended by law no of august on the recovery of biodiversity_ nature and landscapes_ provides that ny person who causes ecological damage has the duty to afford redress paris administrative court_ february oxfam france et autres_ no as regards the commitments of the french state and the general obligation to combat climate change_ the paris administrative court found support in the same texts referred to in the grande synthe case_ namely france commitments under the unfccc_ the paris agreement_ decision no ec of april on the effort of member states to reduce their ghg emissions_ and regulation eu of may on binding annual ghg emission reductions and article of the energy code and article of the environment code the administrative court also referred to article of the environment charter_ which recalls the existence of the preventive principle already enshrined in law_ and provides that veryone shall_ in accordance with the conditions laid down by law_ avoid causing any damage to the environment or_ failing that_ limit its consequences the administrative court inferred that it was clear from all the above provisions that the french state had recognised the urgency of combating current climate change and acknowledged its capacity to take effective action in relation to that phenomenon in order to limit the causes and mitigate the adverse consequences and had chosen to exercise its regulatory powers_ in particular by pursuing public policy of reducing ghg emissions from french territory_ through which it had undertaken to achieve_ within specific and successive deadlines_ certain number of targets in this sphere as to the implementation of those state commitments in the light of the ghg emissions reduction targets_ the administrative court concluded that the state had to be regarded as having failed to adhere to the first carbon budget and as not having carried out the actions which it itself had recognised as apt to reduce ghg emissions in reaching that conclusion the administrative court found support_ inter alia_ in the same reports of the high council on climate cited by the conseil état in its decision in the grande synthe case observing that the state could not be held liable for the alleged ecological damage except in so far as the failure to adhere to the first carbon budget had contributed to the increase in ghg emissions the administrative court_ in an interlocutory judgment_ ordered further investigations it found that_ as the evidence stood_ it could not determine the specific measures to be ordered to enable the state to achieve the targets that france had set itself in terms of reducing ghg emissions following that investigative measure_ in subsequent judgment of october the administrative court ordered the prime minister and the competent ministers to take_ by december all appropriate measures to remedy the environmental damage and prevent aggravation of the damage_ in an amount equal to the uncompensated share of ghg emissions under the first carbon budget_ namely mt co e_ and subject to an adjustment in line with the citepa technical centre for studies on air pollution centre technique études de la pollution atmosphérique estimated data as at january in the administrative court view_ those concrete measures were apt to afford redress for the alleged damage paris administrative court_ october oxfam france et autres_ no the court did not impose coercive fine at that stage in his opinion on the second decision of the conseil état of july in the grande synthe case_ the public rapporteur set out the following considerations regarding the specific nature of the climate cases examined in france compared with other european states the case before you belongs to the category of actions directed against the states climate policy applications for judicial review_ within which climate related cases again take various forms one of the main distinctions between these cases is the rule relied upon in seeking the setting aside of the decision the application may be based on an alleged breach of human rights_ as recognised in particular by the supreme court of the netherlands in the urgenda case_ or on specific ghg emission standards that are binding on states or governments these standards may be derived from international law_ where it can be relied upon before the national courts_ from constitutional law_ as in the case before the german constitutional court or from legislation_ as in the present case and in the friends of the irish environment case the last aspect to be addressed in order to determine the case before you is undoubtedly the most delicate all these cases seek to criticise shortcomings in climate policy in an address to the court of cassation on may entitled environnement les citoyens_ le droit_ les juges the environment citizens_ the law and judges the vice president of the conseil état_ bruno lasserre_ made the following remarks on the first decisions given by the administrative courts the decision of the conseil état of november in the grande synthe case_ the decision of the conseil état_ sitting in plenary_ of july in the case of association les amis de la terre france_ and the ruling of the paris administrative court of february in the case of the century one of the innovations of this line of case law concerns the legal scope conferred_ first_ on the paris agreement_ which the conseil état_ followed by the paris administrative court_ recognised for the first time as having interpretative force and_ secondly_ on the ghg emissions reduction targets laid down in eu law and national law_ since the administrative court took decisive step in finding that those targets are not merely aspirational_ but binding thus_ the conseil état has opened new avenue in relation to climate cases_ which the national courts had hitherto viewed mainly through the lens of fundamental rights_ at least in their most emblematic decisions these include_ for example_ the urgenda decisions_ based on articles and of the european convention on human rights_ and the recent decision of the karlsruhe constitutional court based on provision of the basic law protecting the natural foundations of life however_ the approach of the courts varies significantly depending on whether they are verifying the state compliance with specific and detailed undertakings or examining whether its actions are compatible with such general principles as the right to life or the right to respect for private life two standards which therefore influence the method and_ more fundamentally_ the stance adopted by the courts finally_ the conseil état has adapted to current efforts to tackle climate change by inaugurating new type of review_ which could be termed pathway review the time limits laid down in law for achievement of the targets may be distant and even but for the courts to wait ten_ twenty or thirty years to verify whether they have been achieved would mean denying the urgency of taking action now and depriving their review of all meaningful effect from the outset_ given the very high inertia of the climate system pathway review is thus akin to monitoring compliance in advance this means that the court must be satisfied_ at the point at which it takes its decision_ not that the targets have been achieved_ but that they may be achieved_ that they are in the process of being achieved_ that they form part of credible and verifiable pathway examples of orders and coercive fines imposed in climate cases in the case of association les amis de la terre france et autres_ on an application for judicial review_ the conseil état_ having ordered the prime minister and the minister responsible for the environment to take all necessary measures by march gave decision on july in which it ordered the state to pay coercive fine unless it could demonstrate_ within six months of service of the decision_ that it had implemented the decision of july in each of the areas concerned the conseil état fixed the amount of the fine at eur million for each six month period until the date of enforcement conseil état_ july association les amis de la terre france et autres_ no the conseil état subsequently assessed the interim amount of the fine by decision of august it ordered the state to pay the sum of eur million in respect of the six month period from january to july in his opinion on this case_ the public rapporteur made the following remarks concerning the issue of the proper recipient of the sums payable by the state by way of fines in climate cases this is where the innovative reasoning of your plenary judgment comes in_ since the applicable provision is the second sub paragraph of article according to which the portion not paid to the applicant is allocated to the state budget however_ since the purpose of the coercive fine is to compel public law entity to perform the obligations imposed on it by court decision_ those provisions are not applicable where the coercive fine in question is payable by the state in such cases_ where it appears necessary for effective enforcement of the judicial decision_ the court may_ even of its own motion_ and having obtained the observations of the parties and of the legal entity or entities concerned on this point_ decide to allocate that portion to public law entity which has sufficient autonomy vis vis the state and whose activities relate to the subject matter of the dispute_ or to private law_ non profit entity which_ in accordance with its articles of association_ carries out actions in the general interest that are likewise connected to that subject matter that is the wording of your plenary judgment in order to determine which persons other than the state may receive the proceeds of all or part of the coercive fine_ it is important to bear in mind the purpose of coercive fines_ which is to compel the state to enforce judicial decision as is incumbent upon it in accordance with the rule of law in line with that opinion_ the conseil état therefore ordered that the sum of eur million be paid out as follows eur mainly to four public institutions active in the environmental field_ namely the environment and energy management agency ademe the centre for studies and expertise on risk_ environment_ mobility and planning cerema the national health_ food_ environment and work safety agency anses and the national institute for the industrial environment and risk ineris with the remainder to be paid to the air quality monitoring associations in the most affected regions in decision of october the conseil état again assessed the interim amount of the coercive fine_ for the two six month periods from july to july and ordered the state to pay the sum of eur million_ of which eur was to be paid out mainly to the same public institutions in further decision of november the conseil état found that the decision of july had been partially executed and ordered the state to pay the sum of eur million to the above mentioned public institutions and associations_ as well as to the association les amis de la terre france lastly_ that case also resulted in judgment of the cjeu finding an infringement in view of france failure to comply with the limit values for concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter laid down in directive ec judgment of october in commission france_ eu paragraphs germany in the case of neubauer and others federal republic of germany the german federal constitutional court the gfcc examined four constitutional complaints directed against certain provisions of the federal climate change act of december bundes and against the state failure to take further measures to reduce ghg emissions the applicants grounded their claims on the right to life and integrity article first sentence_ of the basic law the right to property and the right of inheritance article of the basic law as well as on fundamental right to future consistent with human dignity and fundamental right to an ecological minimum standard of living_ which they derived from article in conjunction with article and from article in conjunction with article first sentence_ of the basic law the gfcc held that the provisions of the federal climate change act were incompatible with fundamental rights in so far as they lacked sufficient specifications for further emission reductions from onwards in all other respects_ the constitutional complaints were rejected the gfcc held that it could not be ascertained that the legislature_ in introducing these provisions_ had violated its constitutional duty to protect the complainants from the risks of climate change or failed to satisfy the obligation arising from article of the basic law to take climate action however_ the challenged provisions did violate the freedoms of the complainants_ some of whom were still very young_ because the provisions irreversibly shifted major emission reduction burdens into periods after the fact that ghg emissions had to be reduced followed from the basic law_ among other things the constitutional climate goal arising from its article these future obligations to reduce emissions had an impact on practically every type of freedom because virtually all aspects of human life still involved the emission of ghg and were thus potentially threatened by drastic restrictions after therefore_ the legislature should have taken precautionary steps to mitigate these major burdens in order to safeguard the freedoms guaranteed by fundamental rights the official headnotes of the order summarised the findings as follows the protection of life and physical integrity under art first sentence of the basic law encompasses protection against impairments of guaranteed interests caused by environmental pollution_ regardless of who or what circumstances are the cause the state duty of protection arising from art first sentence of the basic law also encompasses the duty to protect life and health against the risks posed by climate change it can furthermore give rise to an objective duty to protect future generations art of the basic law obliges the state to take climate action this includes the aim of achieving climate neutrality art of the basic law does not take absolute precedence over other interests in cases of conflict_ it must be balanced against other constitutional interests and principles within the balancing process_ the obligation to take climate action is accorded increasing weight as climate change intensifies if there is scientific uncertainty regarding causal relationships of environmental relevance_ special duty of care imposed upon the legislator by art of the basic law also for the benefit of future generations entails an obligation to take account of sufficiently reliable indications pointing to the possibility of serious or irreversible impairments as an obligation to take climate action_ art of the basic law has an international dimension the fact that no state can resolve the problems of climate change on its own due to the global nature of the climate and global warming does not invalidate the national obligation to take climate action under this obligation_ the state is compelled to engage in internationally oriented activities to tackle climate change at the global level and is required to promote climate action within the international framework the state cannot evade its responsibility by pointing to ghg emissions in other states in exercising its mandate and prerogative to specify the law_ the legislator has formulated the climate goal of art of the basic law in permissible manner_ currently setting out that the increase in the global average temperature should be limited to well below oc and preferably to oc above pre industrial levels art of the basic law is justiciable legal provision designed to commit the political process to favouring of ecological interests_ partly with view to future generations compatibility with art of the basic law is required in order to justify under constitutional law any state interference with fundamental rights under certain conditions_ the basic law imposes an obligation to safeguard fundamental freedom over time and to spread the opportunities associated with freedom proportionately across generations in their subjective dimension_ fundamental rights as intertemporal guarantees of freedom afford protection against the ghg reduction burdens imposed by art of the basic law being unilaterally offloaded onto the future furthermore_ in its objective dimension_ the protection mandate laid down in art of the basic law encompasses the necessity to treat the natural foundations of life with such care and to leave them in such condition that future generations who wish to carry on preserving these foundations are not forced to engage in radical abstinence respecting future freedom also requires initiating the transition to climate neutrality in good time in practical terms_ this means that transparent specifications for the further course of ghg reduction must be formulated at an early stage_ providing orientation for the required development and implementation processes and conveying sufficient degree of developmental urgency and planning certainty the legislator itself must set out the necessary provisions specifying the overall emission amounts that are allowed for certain periods as regards the method by which the legal framework for the allowed emission amounts is adopted_ the legislative process cannot be replaced by reduced form of parliamentary involvement in which the bundestag merely approves the federal government ordinances this is because it is precisely the special public function of the legislative process that makes the adoption of parliamentary legislation necessary here it is true that having parliamentary legislation in areas of law that are constantly subject to new developments and knowledge can in some cases be detrimental to the protection of fundamental rights this notion draws on the concept of dynamic fundamental rights protection foundationally_ see bverfge however_ this concept cannot be used here as an objection against the requirement for parliamentary legislation the challenge is not to protect fundamental rights by ensuring that the legal framework keeps pace with new developments and knowledge the challenge is to create framework that makes further developments aimed at protecting fundamental rights possible in the first place ireland in the case of friends of the irish environment clg the government of ireland_ ireland and the attorney general the supreme court of ireland was asked to examine the adequacy of domestic measures taken in relation to climate change in the light of statutory provisions enacted in as well as rights based arguments under the constitution and the convention in relation to the right to life and the right to bodily integrity the relevant concluding part of the judgment_ delivered by the then chief justice_ reads as follows in this judgment first consider the argument put forward by fie to the effect that the plan does not comply with its legislative remit under the act and is_ therefore_ ultra vires it is noted that there was no question raised at the hearing as to the standing of fie to make arguments along those lines for the reasons set out in this judgment conclude that_ contrary to the submissions made on behalf of the government_ fie should be entitled to pursue the wider range of argument on this issue addressed in their written submissions also conclude that the issues are justiciable and do not amount to an impermissible impingement by the courts into areas of policy what might once have been policy has become law by virtue of the enactment of the act also conclude that the act_ and in particular requires sufficient level of specificity in the measures identified in compliant plan that are required to meet the national transitional objective by so that reasonable and interested person could make judgement both as to whether the plan in question is realistic and as to whether they agree with the policy options for achieving the nto which such plan specifies the act as whole involves both public participation in the process leading to the adoption of plan but also transparency as to the formal government policy_ adopted in accordance with statutory regime_ for achieving what is now the statutory policy of meeting the nto by compliant plan is not five year plan but rather plan covering the full period remaining to while the detail of what is intended to happen in later years may understandably be less complete_ compliant plan must be sufficiently specific as to policy over the whole period to for the reasons also set out in this judgment_ have concluded that the plan falls well short of the level of specificity required to provide that transparency and to comply with the provisions of the act on that basis_ propose that the plan be quashed have also considered in this judgment whether it is appropriate to go on to deal with any of the further issues raised_ given that propose that the plan be quashed and that it follows that an identical plan cannot be made in the future however_ as the issues of standing debated in this appeal could well arise in any future challenge to new plan_ do address those questions for the reasons set out in this judgment conclude that fie_ as corporate entity which does not enjoy in itself the right to life or the right to bodily integrity_ does not have standing to maintain the rights based arguments sought to be put forward whether under the constitution or under the echr also conclude that it has not been shown that it is necessary to allow fie to have standing under the exception to the general rule_ which arises in circumstances where refusing standing would make the enforcement of important rights either impossible or excessively difficult on that basis did not consider it appropriate to address the rights based arguments put forward_ but do offer views on the question of whether there is an unenumerated or_ as would prefer to put it_ derived right under the constitution to healthy environment while not ruling out the possibility that constitutional rights and obligations may well be engaged in the environmental field in an appropriate case_ express the view that the asserted right to healthy environment is either superfluous if it does not extend beyond the right to life and the right to bodily integrity or is excessively vague and ill defined if it does go beyond those rights as thus formulated_ express the view that such right cannot be derived from the constitution would reserve the position of whether_ and if in what form_ constitutional rights and state obligations may be relevant in environmental litigation to case in which those issues would prove crucial the netherlands in state of the netherlands stichting urgenda december nl hr the supreme court of the netherlands upheld the lower courts order directing the state to reduce ghg by the end of by at least compared to the official summary of the judgment reads as follows the issue in this case is whether the dutch state is obliged to reduce_ by the end of the emission of ghg originating from dutch soil by at least compared to and whether the courts can order the state to do so urgenda claim and the opinions of the district court and the court of appealurgenda sought court order directing the state to reduce the emission of ghg so that_ by the end of those emissions will have been reduced by or in any case at by at least compared to in the district court allowed urgenda claim_ in the sense that the state was ordered to reduce emissions by the end of by at least compared to in the court of appeal confirmed the district court judgment appeal in cassationthe state instituted an appeal in cassation in respect of the court of appeal decision_ asserting large number of objections to that decision the deputy procurator general and the advocate general advised the supreme court to reject the state appeal and thus to allow the court of appeal decision to stand opinion of the supreme courtthe supreme court concludes that the state appeal in cassation must be rejected that means that the order which the district court issued to the state and which was confirmed by the court of appeal_ directing the state to reduce ghg by the end of by at least compared to will stand as final order the supreme court opinion rests on the facts and assumptions which were established by the court of appeal and which were not disputed by the state or urgenda in cassation in cassation_ the supreme court determines whether the court of appeal properly applied the law and whether_ based on the facts that may be taken into consideration_ the court of appeal opinion is comprehensible and adequately substantiated the grounds for the supreme court judgment are laid down below in sections of the judgment these grounds will be summarised below this summary does not supersede the grounds for this judgment and does not fully reflect the supreme court opinion dangerous climate change see paras below urgenda and the state both endorse the view of climate science that genuine threat exists that the climate will undergo dangerous change in the coming decades there is great deal of agreement on the presence of that threat in climate science and the international community in that respect and briefly put_ this comes down to the following the emission of ghg including co is leading to higher concentration of those gases in the atmosphere these ghg retain the heat radiated by the earth because over the last century and half since the start of the industrial revolution_ an ever increasing volume of ghg is being emitted_ the earth is becoming warmer and warmer in that period_ the earth has warmed by approximately oc_ the largest part of which oc has occurred in the last forty years climate science and the international community largely agree on the premise that the warming of the earth must be limited to no more than oc_ and according to more recent insights to no more than oc the warming of the earth beyond that temperature limit may have extremely dire consequences_ such as extreme heat_ extreme drought_ extreme precipitation_ disruption of ecosystems that could jeopardise the food supply_ among other things_ and rise in the sea level resulting from the melting of glaciers and the polar ice caps that warming may also result in tipping points_ as result of which the climate on earth or in particular regions of the earth changes abruptly and comprehensively all of this will jeopardise the lives_ welfare and living environment of many people all over the world_ including in the netherlands some of these consequences are already happening right now protection of human rights based on the echr see paras below the european convention on the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms echr requires the states which are parties to the convention to protect the rights and freedoms established in the convention for their inhabitants article echr protects the right to life_ and article echr protects the right to respect for private and family life according to the case law of the european court of human rights ecthr contracting state is obliged by these provisions to take suitable measures if real and immediate risk to people lives or welfare exists and the state is aware of that risk the obligation to take suitable measures also applies when it comes to environmental hazards that threaten large groups or the population as whole_ even if the hazards will only materialise over the long term while articles and echr are not permitted to result in an impossible or burden being imposed on state_ those provisions do oblige the state to take measures that are actually suitable to avert the imminent hazard as much as reasonably possible pursuant to article echr_ national law must offer an effective legal remedy against violation or imminent violation of the rights that are safeguarded by the echr this means that the national courts must be able to provide effective legal protection global problem and national responsibility see paras below the risk of dangerous climate change is global in nature ghg are emitted not just from dutch territory_ but around the world the consequences of those emissions are also experienced around the world the netherlands is party to the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc the objective of that convention is to keep the concentration of ghg in the atmosphere to level at which disruption of the climate system through human action can be prevented the unfccc is based on the premise that all member countries must take measures to prevent climate change_ in accordance with their specific and options each country is thus responsible for its own share that means that country cannot escape its own share of the responsibility to take measures by arguing that compared to the rest of the world_ its own emissions are relatively limited in scope and that reduction of its own emissions would have very little impact on global scale the state is therefore obliged to reduce ghg emissions from its territory in proportion to its share of the responsibility this obligation of the state to do its part is based on articles and echr_ because there is grave risk that dangerous climate change will occur that will endanger the lives and welfare of many people in the netherlands what_ specifically_ does the state obligation to do its part entail see paras below when giving substance to the positive obligations imposed on the state pursuant to articles and echr_ one must take into account broadly supported scientific insights and internationally accepted standards important in this respect are_ among other things_ the reports from the ipcc the ipcc is scientific body and organisation that was set up in the context of the united nations to handle climatological studies and developments the ipcc report contained scenario in which the warming of the earth could reasonably be expected to be limited to maximum of oc in order to achieve this target_ the annex countries these being the developed countries_ including the netherlands would have to reduce their emissions in by and in by compared to at the annual climate conferences held in the context of the unfccc since virtually every country has regularly pointed out the necessity of acting in accordance with the scenario of the ipcc and achieving reduction of ghg emissions in the scientifically supported necessity of reducing emissions by in compared to has been expressed on multiple occasions by and in the eu furthermore_ since broadly supported insight has arisen that_ to be safe_ the warming of the earth must remain limited to oc_ rather than oc the paris agreement of therefore expressly states that the states must strive to limit warming to oc that will require an even greater emissions reduction than was previously assumed all in all_ there is great degree of consensus on the urgent necessity for the annex countries to reduce ghg emissions by at least in the consensus on this target must be taken into consideration when interpreting and applying articles and echr the urgent necessity for reduction of in also applies to the netherlands on an individual basis the policy of the state see paras below the state and urgenda are both of the opinion that it is necessary to limit the concentration of ghg in the atmosphere in order to achieve either the target or the target their views differ_ however_ with regard to the speed at which ghg emissions must be reduced until the state policy was aimed at achieving an emissions reduction in of compared to according to the state_ that was necessary to stay on credible pathway to keep the target within reach after however_ the state reduction target for was lowered from reduction by the netherlands to reduction in an eu context after the reduction in the state intends to accelerate the reduction to in and in those targets for and have since been laid down in the dutch climate act the state has not explained_ however_ that and why reduction of just in is considered responsible in an eu context_ in contrast to the reduction in which is internationally broadly supported and is considered necessary there is broad consensus within climate science and the international community that the longer reduction measures to achieve the envisaged final target are postponed_ the more comprehensive and more expensive they will become postponement also creates greater risk of an abrupt climate change occurring as the result of tipping point being reached in light of that generally endorsed insight_ it was up to the state to explain that the proposed acceleration of the reduction after would be feasible and sufficiently effective to meet the targets for and and thus to keep the target and the target within reach the state did not do this_ however the court of appeal was thus entitled to rule that the state must comply with the target_ considered necessary by the international community_ of reduction by at least in the courts and the political domain see paras below the state has asserted that it is not for the courts to undertake the political considerations necessary for decision on the reduction of ghg emissions in the dutch system of government_ the decision making on ghg emissions belongs to the government and parliament they have large degree of discretion to make the political considerations that are necessary in this regard it is up to the courts to decide whether_ in taking their decisions_ the government and parliament have remained within the limits of the law by which they are bound those limits ensue from the echr_ among other things the dutch constitution requires the dutch courts to apply the provisions of this convention_ and they must do so in accordance with the ecthr interpretation of these provisions this mandate to the courts to offer legal protection_ even against the government_ is an essential component of democratic state under the rule of law the court of appeal judgment is consistent with the foregoing_ as the court of appeal held that the state policy regarding ghg reduction is obviously not meeting the requirements pursuant to articles and echr to take suitable measures to protect the residents of the netherlands from dangerous climate change furthermore_ the order which the court of appeal issued to the state was limited to the lower limit of the internationally endorsed_ minimum necessary reduction of in the order that was issued leaves it up to the state to determine which specific measures it will take to comply with that order if legislative measures are required to achieve such compliance_ it is up to the state to determine which specific legislation is desirable and necessary conclusionin short_ the essence of the supreme court judgment is that the order which the district court issued to the state and which was confirmed by the court of appeal_ directing the state to reduce ghg by the end of by at least compared to will be allowed to stand pursuant to articles and echr_ the court of appeal can and may conclude that the state is obliged to achieve that reduction_ due to the risk of dangerous climate change that could have severe impact on the lives and welfare of the residents of the netherlands norway in judgment of december the supreme court of norway ruled on the compliance with the right to healthy environment article of the constitution of royal decree of june concerning petroleum production licences awarded for blocks on the norwegian continental shelf in the marine areas referred to as the south barents sea south and the southeast barents sea the case also raised the issue of whether the decisions complied with article on the right to life or article on the right to respect for private and family life_ and with the corresponding articles and of the convention the supreme court concluded that the decision in question to award the licences violated neither article nor article of the convention nor did it find violation of article of the constitution the case is currently pending before the court greenpeace nordic and others norway_ application no the relevant parts of the judgment read as follows subject matter this case concerns the validity of royal decree of june the decree the decision concerns ten petroleum production licences awarded for total of blocks or parts of blocks on the norwegian continental shelf in the marine areas referred to as the south barents sea south and the southeast barents sea the rd licensing round the decision has its legal basis in section of the petroleum act the key issue raised is the decision compliance with article of the constitution on the right to healthy environment the case also raises the issue of whether the decisions complies with article on the right to life or article on the right to respect for private and family life_ and with the corresponding articles and of the european convention on human rights echr or whether the decision is otherwise invalid due to procedural errors the crux of the matter is the interpretation of article of the constitution and to which extent it confers substantive rights on individuals that may be asserted in court the parties agree that we are facing major challenges related to climate change_ that at least considerable share of the last century temperature increase on earth is due to ghg emissions_ and that these emissions must be reduced to halt_ and hopefully reverse_ the trend the overall constitutional issue is which role the courts are to play in the environmental work the case touches upon the principle of separation of powers and the tripartite system of the legislature_ the executive and the judiciary is the decision incompatible with article or of the echr_ or article or of the constitution there is no doubt that the consequences of climate change in norway may lead to loss of human lives_ for instance through floods or landslides the question is yet whether there is an adequate link between production licences in the rd licensing round and possible loss of human lives_ which would meet the requirement of real and immediate risk in my view_ the answer is no first_ it is uncertain whether or to which extent the decision will actually lead to ghg emissions second_ the possible impact on the climate will be discernible in the more distant future although the climate threat is real_ the decision does not involve_ within the meaning of the echr_ real and immediate risk of loss of life for citizens in norway thus_ no violation of article of the echr is found to this point_ the court of human rights has not assessed applications related to climate however_ the court has recently communicated an application from six youths against norway and other countries the case concerned the failure to cut emissions with particular reference to forest fires and heatwaves in portugal in and nonetheless_ there is nothing in present case law to suggest that the subject matter in climate cases will differ from that in cases concerning environmental harm in general with the significance the court until now has ascribed to direct and immediate find it clear that the effects of possible future emissions due to the licences awarded in the rd licensing round do not fall within article of the echr during the appeal hearing_ particular attention has been given to the urgenda case from the netherlands in this case_ declaratory judgment was sought by the dutch environmental organisation urgenda against the dutch state urgenda requested judgment affirming that the dutch state had duty within to reduce ghg emissions by percent_ or at least percent_ compared with the dutch supreme court hoge raad upheld in judgment december ecli nl hr unofficial english translation the rulings of the lower instances_ ordering the dutch state to reduce ghg emissions by percent within compared with among other things_ hoge raad cited articles and of the echr the judgment from the netherlands has little transfer value to the case at hand first_ the urgenda case questioned whether the dutch government could reduce the general emission targets it had already set it was thus not question of prohibiting particular measure or possible future emissions secondly_ it was not question of challenging the validity of an administrative decision the environmental groups have finally mentioned that the court of human rights may identify the content of the rights on the basis of international agreements constituting common ground between the member states_ see the grand chamber judgment november demir and baykara turkey paragraphs such principle may hardly be applied to environmental issues_ as the echr does not have separate environment provision in any case_ it has not been demonstrated that the production licences constitute breach of our international obligations add that most of the supporting documents that have been submitted and added to the case in accordance with section of the dispute act_ generally relate to international obligations_ both under the echr and international law in general these contain nothing that changes my assessments against this background_ the decision is not violation of article or of the echr spain in the case of greenpeace spain and others spain_ several associations and five individuals challenged the relevant national energy and climate plan on the grounds that its ghg emissions reduction target reduction of ghg emissions of by compared to levels did not comply with the paris agreement they asked the courts to modify the plan by imposing ghg reduction target_ compared to levels_ by on july the supreme court sts dismissed the claimants action holding that under the relevant domestic law_ courts could not impose on the government measure such as that requested in the present case unless there was clear conflict of regulations with higher norm that left no discretion to the executive_ which had not been the case in the case at hand the supreme court noted that ghg reduction targets had very significant implications for the national economy and the government socio economic policies tightening them would impose significant sacrifices on present generations and granting the claim would amount to an excessive invasion into the prerogatives of the government moreover_ the plan was compliant with eu law_ which reflected ambitious efforts in the fight against climate change the european union was in the process of updating its ghg reduction targets and spain would have to coordinate its actions with eu law the united kingdom in plan earth and four other citizens prime minister the appellants unsuccessfully challenged before the high court of justice the lawfulness of the policies of the united kingdom government relating to climate change they alleged breach of section of the human rights act by way of article and or article of the convention discussing these claims_ mr justice bourne held_ in particular the insuperable problem with the article claim and with any article claim based on the physical or psychological effects of climate change on the claimants is that there is an administrative framework to combat the threats posed by climate change_ in the form of the act and all the policies and measures adopted under it that framework includes and contemplates the role of the ccc in advising on_ and assessing_ policies and measures that framework is constantly evolving he court is not well equipped to form its own views on the matters in question am being invited to adopt the views expressed in selective quotations from the work of the ccc and others when refer to selective quotation am not questioning the good faith of any of the parties rather am pointing out that the court does not have and cannot acquire expertise in this complex area_ and will always be dependent on competing extracts from global debate even if could overcome the problem of selective quotation_ would not be equipped to assess the correctness of what is being quoted in the same case_ ruling on an application to the court of appeal for permission to appeal against the high court refusal to grant permission to apply for judicial review_ lord justice singh refused the application and noted as follows the fundamental difficulty which the claimants face is that there is no authority from the european court of human rights on which they can rely_ citing the paris agreement as being relevant to the interpretation of the echr_ articles and they do rely on decisions of the highest courts of other parties to the echr_ in particular the supreme court of the netherlands_ but_ as the judge observed in the present case_ we do not know what the constitutional context was for such decisions section of the hra requires courts in this country to take into account relevant decisions of the european court of human rights in general_ we follow those decisions belgium in the case of vzw klimaatzaak the kingdom of belgium and others_ an association and individuals brought an action against

demonstration of march as follows at paragraph in march considerable tension occurred over the well publicized plans of greek cypriot women group to organize large demonstration with the announced

rights and fundamental freedoms hereby declares to accept the competence of the european commission of human rights and to receive petitions according to article art of the convention subject to the following the recognition of the right of petition extends only to allegations concerning acts or omissions of public authorities in turkey performed within the boundaries of the territory to which the constitution of the republic of turkey is applicable ii the circumstances and conditions under which turkey_ by virtue of article art of the convention_ derogates from her obligations under the convention in special circumstances must be interpreted_ for the purpose of the competence attributed to the commission under this declaration_ in the light of articles to of the turkish constitution iii the competence attributed to the commission under this declaration shall not comprise matters regarding the legal status of military personnel and in particular_ the system of discipline in the armed forces iv for the purpose of the competence attributed to the commission under this declaration_ the notion of democratic society in paragraphs of articles and art art art art of the convention

january the secretary general of the council of europe transmitted the above declaration to the other high contracting parties to the convention indicating that he had drawn the turkish authorities attention to the fact that the notification made pursuant to article para art of the convention in no way prejudged the legal questions which might arise concerning the validity of turkey declaration in letter dated february to the secretary general_ the permanent representative of turkey to the council of europe stated that the wording of article para art of the convention offered no basis for expressing opinions or adding comments when transmitting copies of the turkish declaration to the high contracting parties he added international treaty practice_ in particular that followed by the secretary general of the united nations as depositary to similar important treaties as the statute of the international court of justice or the covenants and conventions dealing with human rights and fundamental freedoms_ also confirms that the depositary has to refrain from any comments on the substance of any declaration made by contracting party reactions of various contracting parties to turkey article art declaration on april the deputy minister for foreign affairs of greece wrote to the secretary general stating inter alia that reservations to the european convention on human rights may not be formulated on the basis of any provision other than article art he added furthermore_ article art provides neither directly nor implicitly the possibility of formulating reservations similar to the reservations set out in the turkish declaration the position cannot be otherwise_ for if reservations could be made on the basis of article art such method of proceeding would undermine article art and would sooner or later destroy the very foundations of the convention it follows that the turkish reservations_ as they are outside the scope of article art must be considered as unauthorised reservations and_ accordingly_ as illegal reservations consequently_ they are null and void and may not give rise to any effect in law in letter of april the permanent representative of sweden wrote to the secretary general stating inter alia that the reservations and declarations raise various legal questions as to the scope of the turkish recognition the government therefore reserves the right to return to this question in the light of such decisions by the competent bodies of the council of europe that may occur in connection with concrete petitions from individuals the

tacit recognition by luxembourg of the turkish government reservations in letter of april to the secretary general the permanent representative of denmark stated inter alia as follows in the view of the danish government_ the reservations and declarations which accompany the said recognition raise various legal questions as to the scope of the recognition the government therefore reserves its right to return to these questions in the light of future decisions by the competent bodies of the council of europe in connection with concrete petitions from individuals the permanent representative of norway_ in his letter of may to the secretary general_ stated that the wording of the declaration could give rise to difficult issues of interpretation as to the scope of the recognition of the right to petition he considered that such issues fell to be resolved by the european commission of human rights in dealing with concrete petitions he added it is therefore desirable to avoid any doubt as to the scope and validity of the recognition by individual states of this right which may be raised by generalised stipulations in respect of the context in which petitions would be accepted as admissible_ interpretative statements or other in letter dated june to the secretary general_ the permanent representative of turkey stated that the points contained in the turkish declaration were not to be considered as reservations in the sense of international treaty law he pointed out_ inter alia_ that the only competent organ to make legally binding assessment as to the validity of the conditions attaching to the article art declaration was the european commission of human rights_ when being seized of an individual application_ and eventually the committee of ministers_ when acting pursuant to article art of the convention the permanent representative of belgium_ in letter of july to the secretary general_ stated that the conditions and qualifications set forth in the declaration raised legal questions as to the system of protection set up under the convention he added belgium therefore reserves the right to express its position in regard to the turkish government declaration_ at later stage and before the competent bodies of the council of europe meanwhile the absence of formal reaction on the merits of the problem should by no means be interpreted as tacit recognition by belgium of the turkish government conditions and qualifications turkey subsequent article art declarations turkey subsequently renewed her declaration under article art of the

surprised by the results of the dna test it stated that there had been an internal inquiry_ since an error had clearly occurred_ but it had proved impossible to identify the individual responsible for

certificate the applicants lodged an appeal with the larino court against this refusal the subsequent proceedings are set out in paragraphs below the public prosecutor asked the larino court to give the child new identity and to issue new birth certificate the subsequent proceedings before the minors courts the decision of the minors court of october as part of the proceedings to make the child available for adoption which were then pending before the minors court see paragraph above the applicants asked psychologist_ dr to prepare report on the child well being the report drawn up by dr on september after four meetings with the child_ indicates that the applicants who were attentive to the child needs had developed deep emotional bond with him the report indicated that the grandparents and other family members also surrounded the child with affection_ and that he was healthy_ lively and responsive dr concluded that the applicants were suitable parents for the child_ both from psychological perspective and in terms of their ability to educate him and bring him up she added that possible removal measures would have devastating consequences for the child_ explaining that he would go through depressive phase on account of sense of abandonment and the loss of the key persons in his life in her opinion_ this could lead to somatic symptoms and compromise the child psycho physical development_ and_ in the long term_ symptoms of psychotic pathology could emerge the applicants asked for the child to be placed with them_ with view to adopting him if necessary by an immediately enforceable decision of october the campobasso minors court ordered that the child be removed from the applicants_ taken into the care of the social services and placed in children home casa famiglia the relevant passages of the minors court decision read as follows in their evidence mr campanelli and mrs paradiso stated that mrs paradiso had travelled to russia carrying her husband semen in special container_ and had there entered into an agreement with the company under this agreement_ mrs paradiso had delivered her husband semen to pre determined clinic one or more eggs from an unknown female donor had been fertilised in vitro with this semen_ and then implanted into another woman_ whose identity is known and who had subsequently given birth to the child in question on february in exchange_ mr campanelli and mrs paradiso had paid large amount of money mrs paradiso stated that the woman who had given birth to the child had waived her rights to him and had consented to him being referred to on the birth certificate_ drawn up in russia_ as the son of mr campanelli and mrs paradiso copy of the informed consent_ given on february by the woman who gave birth to the child_ is on file in these proceedings court appointed expert witness was then instructed to establish whether the minor child was the biological son of giovanni campanelli in her report the court appointed expert witness_ ms concluded that the results obtained by means of typing of the dna of giovanni campanelli and the dna of the minor child rule out giovanni campanelli as the child biological father in today hearing mr campanelli and mrs paradiso referred to their previous evidence and mrs paradiso repeated that she had taken her husband semen to russia to be used for the purpose of the intended fertilisation however_ the conclusions of the court appointed expert witness have not been challenged at the close of the hearing_ the public prosecutor requested that the application by mr campanelli and mrs paradiso be refused_ that the minor child be placed in the care of third parties and that temporary guardian be appointed for him the child guardian ad litem asked that the child be placed in care under section of the adoption act and that guardian be appointed mr campanelli and mrs paradiso requested primarily that the court award them temporary care of the child with view to subsequent adoption in the alternative_ they requested the suspension of these proceedings pending the criminal classification of the offences_ and the suspension of the above mentioned criminal proceedings against them and of the proceedings before the campobasso court of appeal to challenge the refusal to register the child birth certificate again in the alternative_ they requested the suspension of these proceedings under section of law no for the purpose of possible repatriation of the minor child to russia_ or_ failing that_ for the child to be placed with them under section of the cited law that being the case_ the court finds that the statements by mr campanelli and mrs paradiso regarding the delivery to russia of giovanni campanelli genetic material are not supported by any evidence on the other hand_ it has been established that the minor is neither the biological son of donatina paradiso_ nor_ given the evidence of the expert report_ of giovanni campanelli at the present time the only certainty is the identity of the woman who gave birth to the baby the biological parents of the baby_ that is_ the man and the woman who provided the gametes_ remain unknown in the light of this evidence_ the present case cannot be viewed as case of so called gestational surrogacy_ which is the case where the surrogate mother who gives birth to the baby has no genetic link to him or her_ the fertilisation having taken place with the egg of third woman indeed_ in order to be able to talk of gestational or traditional surrogacy in the latter_ the surrogate mother makes her own ovules available there must be biological link between the child and at least one of the two intended parents in this specific case_ mr campanelli and mrs paradiso biological link which_ as has been seen_ is non existent in the court view_ the applicants had thus placed themselves in an unlawful situation it follows that by bringing baby to italy_ passing him off as their own son_ in blatant infringement of the provisions of our legislation law no of may governing inter country adoption of children_ mr campanelli and mrs paradiso have acted unlawfully besides any criminal offences which may have been committed infringement of section of law no which are not within the jurisdiction of this court_ it is noted that the agreement entered into between mrs paradiso and the company had unlawful elements since_ given the terms of the agreement the delivery of mr campanelli genetic material for the fertilisation of another woman ovules it was in breach of the ban on the use of assisted reproductive technology of heterologous type laid down by section of law no of february in any event_ it is pointed out that despite being in possession of the authorisation for inter country adoption issued by order of this court on december mr campanelli and mrs paradiso_ as has been stated_ intentionally evaded the provisions of law no which provide not only that the intended adoptive parents must apply to an authorised body section but also for the involvement of the commission for inter country adoption section the only body competent to authorise entry and permanent residence of foreign child in italy section the court therefore found it necessary_ first and foremost_ to put an end to this unlawful situation it is therefore necessary_ above all_ to prevent this unlawful situation from continuing_ since to maintain it would be equivalent to ratifying unlawful conduct in open violation of the provisions of our legislation accordingly_ it is necessary to remove the minor child from mr campanelli and mrs paradiso and place him in an appropriate structure with view to identifying suitable couple to foster the child as soon as possible the social services department of the municipality of colletorto is therefore instructed to identify an appropriate structure and to place the child in it the italian legislation on adoption applies to this child in accordance with section of law no there being no doubt that he is in italy in state of abandonment_ having been deprived of his biological parents and other relatives_ and the mother who gave birth to him having renounced him admittedly_ it cannot be denied that the child will in all likelihood suffer harm from being separated from mr campanelli and mrs paradiso however_ given the age of the child and the short time he has spent with them_ the court cannot agree with the conclusions of the report by psychologist dr instructed by mr campanelli and mrs paradiso finding that it is certain that the child separation from them would entail devastating consequences indeed_ according to the literature on this subject_ the mere separation from the main care givers is not causal agent of state in child unless other causal factors are present the trauma caused by the separation from mr campanelli and mrs paradiso will not be irreparable_ given that search will begin immediately for couple able to attenuate the consequences of the trauma_ through compensatory process that will encourage new adaptation it is also pointed out that the fact that mr campanelli and mrs paradiso and in particular mrs paradiso have put up with the hardships and the difficulties of mrs paradiso has also stated that during one of these interventions her life was at risk and have preferred_ despite being in possession of an approval for inter country adoption_ to circumvent italian legislation on this subject gives rise to the doubt and the fear that the minor child may be an instrument to fulfil narcissistic desire of mr campanelli and mrs paradiso or to exorcise an individual or joint problem in the light of the conduct of mr campanelli and mrs paradiso during the events under examination_ all of this throws consistent shadow over their possession of genuine affective and educational abilities and of the instinct of human solidarity which must be present in any person wishing to bring the children of others into their lives as their own children the separation of the minor child from mr campanelli and mrs paradiso thus corresponds to the best interests of the child according to the applicants_ the court decision was enforced on the same day_ without their having been informed of the decision in advance the appeal against the decision of the minors court the applicants lodged an appeal reclamo before the campobasso court of appeal they argued_ inter alia_ that the italian courts could not contest the russian birth certificate they further requested that no measures be taken concerning the child while the criminal proceedings against them and the proceedings challenging the refusal to enter the birth certificate in the italian civil status register were pending the campobasso court of appeal decision of february by decision of february the campobasso court of appeal dismissed the appeal the court of appeal found that the child was in state of abandonment in stato di abbandono within the meaning of section of the adoption act_ as the applicants were not his parents in those circumstances_ the question of whether or not the applicants were criminally liable and whether or not there had been an error in the use of seminal fluid of unknown origin was not_ in its view_ relevant in the court of appeal opinion_ it was not appropriate to await the outcome of the criminal trial or of the proceedings brought by the applicants to challenge the refusal to enter the particulars of the birth certificate in the register the court of appeal also considered that section of law no the private international law act did not prevent the italian courts from refusing to comply with certified information from foreign state_ and that there was no issue of lack of jurisdiction_ since_ according to section bis of the adoption act_ the italian law governing adoption_ fostering_ and necessary measures in case of urgency shall be applicable to foreign minor child who is in italy in state of abandonment cf also cass no appeal to the court of cassation lay against that decision see paragraph below preventive seizure of the birth certificate in the meantime_ on october the public prosecutor at the larino court had ordered the preventive seizure of the russian birth certificate_ on the ground that it was an essential item of evidence in the prosecutor view_ in all probability the applicants had not only committed the offences with which they were charged_ but they had attempted to conceal them they had_ according to him_ inter alia_ stated that they were the biological parents and had then corrected their versions of events as these were successively disproved the applicants challenged the preventive seizure order by decision of november the campobasso court dismissed the applicants appeal on the ground of the strong suspicions that they had committed the offences in question in particular_ the court noted the following facts the first applicant had spread rumour that she was pregnant she had gone to the italian consulate in moscow and implied that she was the natural mother she had subsequently admitted that the child had been born to surrogate mother she had stated to the carabinieri on may that the second applicant was the biological father_ which had been disproved by the dna tests she had thus made false statements she had been very vague as to the identity of the genetic mother the documents concerning the surrogate motherhood stated that the two applicants had been seen by the russian doctors_ which did not correspond to the fact that the second applicant had not travelled to russia the documents relating to the birth did not give any precise date the court considered that the only certainty was that the child had been born and that he had been handed over to the first applicant against payment of almost euros eur in the court view_ the hypothesis that the applicants had behaved illegally with view to having the particulars of the birth certificate entered in the civil status register and to circumventing the italian legislation thus appeared well founded in november the public prosecutor transmitted the decision regarding the preventive seizure to the minors court and indicated that conviction under section of the adoption act would deprive the applicants of the possibility of fostering affido the child and of adopting him or other minors in the public prosecutor view_ there was therefore no other solution but to proceed with the adoption procedure for the child_ and his temporary placement with foster family had therefore been requested_ in accordance with sections and of the adoption act the public prosecutor repeated his request and emphasised that the child had been removed more than year previously_ and that he had since been living in children home casa famiglia where he had developed meaningful relationships with the persons responsible for his care he explained that the child had thus still not found family environment to replace the one that had been illegally provided by the couple who had brought him to italy according to the public prosecutor_ the child seemed destined for another separation_ even more painful than that from the mother who had given birth to him and then from the woman who claimed to be his mother the proceedings brought by the applicants to challenge the refusal to enter the particulars of the birth certificate in the civil status register an appeal having been lodged to contest the registry office refusal to enter the particulars of the russian birth certificate in the civil status register_ the larino court declined jurisdiction on september the proceedings were subsequently resumed before the campobasso court of appeal the applicants insisted that the particulars of the russian birth certificate be entered in the italian register by an immediately enforceable decision of april the campobasso court of appeal ruled on the transcription of the birth certificate into the italian register by way of introduction_ the court of appeal dismissed the objection raised by the guardian to the effect that the applicants did not have standing to bring an action before that court it acknowledged that the applicants had standing to bring proceedings in that they were referred to as the parents in the birth certificate that they wished to have entered in the civil status register however_ the court of appeal considered it clear that the applicants were not the biological parents and concluded that there had not therefore been gestational surrogacy it noted that the parties were in agreement that the russian legislation presupposed biological link between the child and at least one of the intended parents before the term surrogate motherhood could be used it concluded that the birth certificate was fraudulent ideologicamente falso and in breach of russian law in the court of appeal view_ given that there was nothing to show that the child had russian citizenship_ the applicants argument that italian law was inapplicable ran counter to section of the private international law act_ which stated that the legal parent child relationship was determined by the national law governing the child at the time of his or her birth the court of appeal added that it was contrary to public order to register the contested birth certificate_ since it was fraudulent it stated that although the applicants had pleaded their good faith_ alleging that they were unable to explain why the second applicant seminal fluid had not been used in the russian clinic_ this made no difference to the situation and did not alter the fact that the second applicant was not the biological father in conclusion_ the court of appeal held that it was legitimate to refuse to register the russian birth certificate and to grant the public prosecutor request that new birth certificate be issued the court of appeal therefore ordered that new birth certificate be issued_ indicating that the child was the son of persons unknown_ born in moscow on february and that he would be given new name_ determined in accordance with presidential decree no the fate of the child following execution of the decision issued by the minors court on october the child was placed in children home for about fifteen months_ in location that was unknown to the applicants all contact between the applicants and the child was prohibited they were unable to obtain any news of him in january the child was placed in family with view to his adoption at the beginning of april the guardian asked the minors court to give the child formal identity_ so that he could be registered for school without complications he stated that the child had been placed in family on january but that he did not have an identity this inexistence had significant impact on administrative matters_ particularly with regard to deciding under what name the child was to be registered for school_ for vaccination records_ and for residence while accepting that this situation corresponded to the aim of preventing the applicants from discovering the child whereabouts_ for his own protection_ the guardian explained that temporary formal identity would enable the secrecy surrounding the child real identity to be maintained_ while simultaneously enabling him to have access to public services for the time being_ he was entitled only to use emergency medical services the case file indicates that this request was granted by the minors court and that the child received formal identity the government have indicated that the child has now been adopted the outcome of the proceedings before the minors court the proceedings to make the child available for adoption were resumed before the minors court of campobasso see paragraph above the applicants confirmed their opposition to the child placement with third persons the guardian asked for statement ruling that the applicants no longer had locus standi the public prosecutor asked the minors court not to declare the child available for adoption using the name originally given to him_ on the ground that_ in the meantime_ he had opened second set of proceedings requesting that the child be declared available for adoption under his new identity child of unknown parents on june the minors court held that the applicants no longer had standing to act in the adoption proceedings_ given that they were neither the child parents nor members of his family within the meaning of section of the adoption act the court stated that it would settle the question of the child adoption in the context of the other set of adoption proceedings_ referred to by the public prosecutor the outcome of the criminal proceedings brought against the applicants no information has been provided by the parties concerning subsequent developments in the criminal proceedings

his body with telephone cords the applicant submits that he suffers from series of physical and psychological injuries and disorders after having been subjected to the alleged torture in tunisia in

considered that there had been no violation of the applicant right of access to court the applicant lodged an appeal with the federal supreme court_ dated october in which he asked it to rule that the courts of the republic and the canton of geneva had territorial jurisdiction and to find that the defendants did not enjoy immunity from jurisdiction with regard to the jurisdiction of the swiss courts_ he argued that the purpose of the introduction of forum of necessity in section of the ldip see paragraph below had been to avoid denials of justice_ especially in cases of political persecution_ and that he had provided sufficient evidence that he could not reasonably bring proceedings before foreign court as to the immunity from jurisdiction purportedly enjoyed by tunisia and the applicant submitted that the exercise of public power did not include an entitlement to commit international crimes such as torture he specified in this regard that the very definition of torture in article of the united nations convention against torture and other cruel_ inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of december hereafter the convention against torture see paragraphs et seq below ruled out any immunity lastly_ he referred_ in very general terms_ to article of the united nations convention relating to the status of refugees see paragraph below the federal supreme court judgment of may by judgment of may the reasoning of which was notified to the applicant on september the federal supreme court dismissed the appeal reiterating the reasoning in the first instance judgment_ the federal supreme court considered that the swiss courts did not in any event have territorial jurisdiction the relevant passages of the federal supreme court judgment read as follows it must first be considered whether the swiss courts have jurisdiction to examine the action as tunisia is not party to the convention of september on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters lugano convention_ rs there exists no convention rule between the two states governing the question of forum_ which must therefore be examined in the light of the ldip sections and ldip in this instance_ the jurisdiction of the swiss authorities cannot be derived from the general rule concerning the international jurisdiction of the state of domicile of the defendant contained in section of the ldip_ since the respondents are not domiciled in switzerland the cantonal court was_ moreover_ right in finding that the criteria_ set out in section of the ldip_ for establishing jurisdiction over actions in respect of wrongful acts were not met in so far as the defendants had neither their domicile nor their place of habitual residence or business in switzerland section ldip and neither the wrongful act nor the resultant injury occurred in switzerland section ldip in the absence of an ordinary forum_ the problem must be addressed under section of the ldip_ which concerns the forum of necessity under the latter provision_ where no forum is provided for in switzerland by the ldip and where proceedings in another country prove impossible or one cannot reasonable require that they be brought in that country_ the swiss judicial or administrative authorities of the locality with which the case has sufficient connection have jurisdiction the application of this rule for assigning jurisdiction thus calls for three cumulative conditions to be met firstly_ the swiss authorities do not have jurisdiction under another provision secondly_ legal proceedings in another country are impossible or cannot reasonably be required and_ thirdly_ the case in question has sufficient connection with switzerland in the present case_ the first condition is indisputably fulfilled fulfilment of the second condition appears more problematic_ but in the light of the third condition_ which merits more extensive discussion_ it is not necessary to elaborate further on this question section of the ldip_ which must be interpreted restrictively represents safety valve_ intended to avoid denials of justice in the event of negative conflict of jurisdiction in this connection_ the federal council_ in its authoritative interpretation of this provision_ noted that there are cases that have such tenuous connection with switzerland that it is not appropriate to set in motion the entire judicial system in order to resolve them however_ section lays down an exception to this principle the swiss authorities must assume jurisdiction even in cases where the connection with our country is very tenuous_ where it is impossible to bring proceedings or to lodge an appeal abroad it is for the claimant or the appellant to demonstrate this impossibility where this evidence has been adduced_ jurisdiction reverts to the authority of the locality with which the case has sufficient connection where there are several competing fora in switzerland_ it is the first authority before which an action is brought that has jurisdiction clearly_ the impossibility of bringing and pursuing proceedings abroad can only be examined in the light of the tangible circumstances and of the possible consequences for the individual concerned in the particular case it will ultimately be for the court to recognise_ or not_ its jurisdiction although section ldip may thus seem innately paradoxical in so far as proceedings for which there is no basis for connection with an ordinary forum in switzerland are_ ipso facto_ lacking in any particular connection with this country_ in such way that determining sufficient connection may prove challenging_ and the aim pursued by the law to prevent formal denial of justice difficult to achieve_ this legal provision has not in practice been without effect the cantonal courts in particular have recognised its applicability in the areas of family law_ inheritance and proceedings on debt enforcement and bankruptcy moreover_ legal writers have noted that subsidiary forum must necessarily be recognised in situations of political persecution however_ neither the case law nor legal opinion provide much in the way of guidance concerning civil actions for compensation in respect of damage resulting from crimes against humanity_ life and physical integrity_ committed abroad_ by foreign perpetrators that being stated_ it is necessary to consider what is meant by case cause in the french version in section ldip it is settled case law that the law must_ in the first instance_ be interpreted literally an interpretation which deviates from the literal meaning of text expressed in clear terms is allowable only where there are objective reasons for considering that the text fails to convey the true meaning of the provision concerned such reasons may derive from the drafting history_ from the aim and sense of the provision concerned and from the structure and layout of the law if the text is not absolutely clear_ if it can be interpreted variously_ the approach must be to seek out the true import of the provision having regard to all relevant factors_ including in particular the drafting history_ the intention pursued by the rule_ the spirit and values on which it is based or again its relationship with other legal provisions the federal supreme court does not favour any one method of interpretation but adopts pragmatic plurality in its search for the true meaning of the rule in particular_ it takes as basis literal understanding of the text only where this offers_ with no ambiguity_ solution that is substantively just atf iii iii and the judgments cited therein in itself_ the meaning to be attributed to the term cause is uncertain in the sense that it does not have general definition in the laws of civil procedure of the french speaking cantons see_ however_ bertossa gaillard guyet schmidt_ commentaire de la loi de procedure civile genevoise_ vol i_ geneva ad article lpc ge_ concerning the force of res judicata_ in which the authors consider that identical claims_ in terms of their content_ based on the same arguments and the same combination of alleged facts_ constitute the objective limit of res judicata that identity is determined by the complete set of legal considerations which formed part of the first application and were adjudicated upon this was how cause was to be understood in former article the alleged facts of the case determine an overall situation sachverhalt prozessstoff which it is for the court to assess but would appear to equate to procédure or demande en justice or in german to rechtsstreit rechtssache prozess angelegenheit causa litigandi or streitgrund at all events_ cause is not the literal and unambiguous translation of the terms sachverhalt or fattispecie used in the german and italian versions of section of the ldip it should be borne in mind_ at this point_ that the latter terms are usually translated in french as énoncé or exposé des faits or état des faits as the versions of the law drafted in the three official languages have the same standing_ the question arises whether the difference between the french wording and that of the other two versions results from an error in the legislative process_ from difference in meaning which becomes apparent only in the context of specific cases according to varying understanding of the legal provision in each of the languages_ or_ lastly_ from linguistic difference attributable either to the non translatability knowingly taken into account in the drafting or to uncertainty on the part of the legislator as to the meaning to be conveyed see schubarth_ die auslegung mehrsprachiger gesetzestexte_ in rapports suisses présentés au xviie congrès international de droit comparé_ zurich et seq especially it seems clear that the first of these possibilities can be ruled out to distinguish between the second and third possibilities the understanding of the term cause in legal french terminology must be considered in this regard_ the cause of the action is the basis of the claim base de la prétention streitgrund rather than sachverhalt though it should be noted that the legal writers are in some disagreement as to the content and scope of that basis some argue that the cause must be seen as legal concept allowing the claim to be defined_ while for others the cause comes down to set of facts giving rise to the legal issues in debate or the legal interest invoked see vincent guinchard_ procédure civile_ th edition_ paris et seq who conclude that the cause of the action is constituted by legally characterised set of facts in the case in point_ it must be acknowledged that comparison with the german and italian versions assists in the interpretation of the french text_ supporting the view that the term cause should be assigned the restricted meaning of set of facts or_ to take literal translation of sachverhalt and fattispeccie exposé or état de faits and not procédure in other words_ it is the cause which concerns the set of facts and the legal argumentation rather than the person of the applicant which must have sufficient connection with switzerland in the present case_ however_ the claimant complains of acts of torture that were allegedly committed in tunisia_ by tunisians resident in tunisia_ against tunisian residing in italy all of the specific features of the case come back to tunisia_ except for the fact of residence in italy at the relevant time the facts of the case thus have no connection with switzerland_ so that the question of whether or not the link with this country is sufficient does not arise in those circumstances_ it is not possible to recognise the jurisdiction of the swiss courts_ short of disregarding the clear text of ection of the ldip see paragraph below the fact that the claimant then chose to come to switzerland cannot change anything_ since it is fact subsequent to the events of the case and_ moreover_ does not form part of it since the absence of sufficient connection between the facts of the case and switzerland suffices to establish the swiss courts lack of jurisdiction_ the appeal must be dismissed_ without it being necessary to examine the issue of immunity from jurisdiction subsequent developments the swiss government made submissions before the grand chamber describing the action taken by the tunisian republic after the fall of the regime in january in order to establish new democracy and political system based on respect for human rights and the rule of law they considered that the possibility of submitting complaints to the newly established courts was the most direct and natural means of promoting reconciliation_ re establishing social peace and improving prevention_ whilst also respecting the steps taken to repair the harm done to the victims in this context_ the government referred to article of the tunisian constitution of january worded as follows the state commits to implementing the transitional justice system in all areas within the timeline set by the related legislation in this regard_ no claim in respect of the non retrospective nature of laws_ or the existence of previous amnesty or pardon_ or the binding force of double jeopardy_ or the statute of limitations or prescription of the crime or punishment_ shall be admitted the government observed that the constituent elements of transitional justice had already been set out in organic law no of december on the introduction of transitional justice and related organisational arrangements enacted by the tunisian parliament on december and published in the official gazette on december the respondent government specified that part iii of title covered accountability and criminal liability in order to prevent impunity and ensure that offenders do not escape punishment section section provided for the establishment of specialised divisions in the courts of first instance_ composed of judges who would receive special training in transitional justice they would rule on cases relating to serious violations of human rights including torture section which in accordance with section were not subject to statutory limitation the government explained that part iv of title focused more specifically on reparation and rehabilitation sections to pursuant to section he compensation of victims of violations is right guaranteed by law and the state shall offer every form of sufficient_ effective redress commensurate with the extent of the violations committed and the individual situation of each victim the government further added that title ii of the law established truth and dignity commission tdc which was an independent body whose members were chosen by the legislative assembly from among public officials known for their neutrality_ impartiality and competence sections and of the organic law under section the tdc work was to cover the entire period from july to december the date of the law promulgation the duration of the tdc work was limited to four years_ starting from the date of appointment of its members section lastly_ the government informed the court that_ according to information obtained by it from the swiss embassy in tunis_ persons who considered themselves victims of the former regime had until june to apply to the tdc the commission was currently dealing with over cases in this capacity_ it was holding hearings which_ since november had also been held in public according to the information received_ it was foreseen that selected cases would be transmitted to the courts at later stage in the investigation process the applicant has not contested these submissions by the swiss government see paragraphs above he specified at the hearing of june that he had in fact contacted the tdc and had received simple acknowledgment of receipt in february but had had no further communication from the tdc since then ii relevant domestic law and practicea relevant domestic law the relevant parts of the federal act on private international law of december ldip as in force at the material time_ provide section in general unless specially provided otherwise in this act_ the swiss judicial or administrative authorities of the defendant domicile

can be found in switzerland and where the claims are essentially based on the same legal and factual grounds_ proceedings may be brought against all of them before the same court having jurisdiction

respect of wrongful act shall be governed by the law of that state where the perpetrator and the injured party do not have their habitual residence in the same state_ those claims shall be governed by the law of the state in which the wrongful act was committed however_ if the result was produced in another state_ the law of that state shall be applicable if the perpetrator ought to have foreseen that the result would be produced there notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs_ where wrongful act violates legal relationship between the perpetrator and the injured party_ the claims submitted in respect of that act shall be governed by the law applicable to that legal relationship article of the swiss code of obligations provides for liability for wrongful act article conditions for liability person who unlawfully causes damage to another_ whether wilfully or through negligence or imprudence_ is required to make reparation person who intentionally causes damage to another by acting contrary to moral standards is also required to make reparation the preparatory work with regard to section of the ldip the federal council dispatch of november on section of the ldip contains the following paragraphs ff forum of necessity the draft law seeks to determine_ in an exhaustive manner_ the swiss authorities international jurisdiction it follows that there is no international jurisdiction in switzerland if this is not provided for in the draft law the reasons for this are known there are cases where the connection with switzerland is so tenuous as not to justify setting in motion the whole machinery of justice in order to settle them but section provides for an exception to this principle the swiss authorities are bound to declare themselves competent even in cases presenting highly tenuous connection with our country where it is impossible to bring an action or lodge an appeal abroad it is for the applicant or the appellant to prove that impossibility where such proof has been adduced_ jurisdiction lies with the authority at the place with which the facts have sufficient connection if there exist several competing fora in switzerland_ jurisdiction lies with the first authority seised clearly_ the impossibility of bringing and proceeding with an action abroad can be examined only in the light of the actual circumstances of the case and that of any consequences that may have arisen for the person concerned ultimately_ it will be for the court concerned to decide whether it has jurisdiction domestic practice concerning section of the ldip the general index of the federal supreme court reports atf contains no case law concerning section of the ldip there is relatively little case law from the swiss courts concerning section of the ldip indeed_ the present case led the federal supreme court to interpret section of the ldip in detail for the first time in its judgment of may the federal supreme court had previously mentioned this provision in judgment of march point without however applying it in an action for release from liability for debt_ the federal supreme court upheld the application of section of the ldip_ which had not been challenged by the defendant_ in judgment of december point holding that there existed sufficient connection with the forum of lugano_ where the claimant had its headquarters_ taken together with the place in which the proceedings were brought without wishing to be exhaustive_ the court also considers it appropriate to take into consideration cantonal practice_ to which the parties and the federal supreme court_ in its judgment regarding the present case cons also referred in judgment of april lgve luzerner gerichts und no the supreme court of the canton of lucerne confirmed that there was sufficient connection with the facts of the case in the context of proceedings to vary the terms of divorce order in so doing_ it specifically noted the swiss nationality of the parties_ the swiss residence of the claimant at the time that the action was brought_ and the fact that the former spouse divorce had already been pronounced by swiss court the court confirmed that section of the ldip was to be interpreted restrictively in order to avoid_ inter alia_ forum shopping in judgment of march ar gvp ausserrhodische gerichts und no the cantonal court of appenzell outer rhodes accepted that the claimant place of residence met the connection criterion in case concerning german national_ resident in switzerland_ who had brought an action before the swiss courts against her husband_ german national resident in spain_ seeking to obtain an advance on legal costs in the context of an application for measures to preserve the marital union in judgment of november point the canton of geneva court of justice_ in additional proceedings to divorce order involving swiss and spanish national and french national who were resident in france_ and in so far as french law did not recognise the system of offsetting vested benefits in an occupational pension plan_ accepted the existence of forum of necessity in the place of the headquarters of the respondent insurance institution_ namely geneva in judgment of may nc the supreme court of the canton of zurich confirmed the existence of sufficient link regarding swiss national domiciled abroad and requesting registration_ in switzerland_ of change of gender iii relevant international law and practicea the united nations convention against torture the relevant provisions the united nations convention against torture and other cruel_ inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment hereafter the convention against torture was ratified by switzerland on december and entered into force on june article provides for the purposes of this convention_ the term torture means any act by which severe pain or suffering_ whether physical or mental_ is intentionally inflicted on person when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of public official or other person acting in an official capacity article of that convention provides for the states parties jurisdiction in criminal matters as follows each state party shall take such measures as may be necessary to establish its jurisdiction over the offences referred to in article in the following cases when the offences are committed in any territory under its jurisdiction or on board ship or aircraft registered in that state when the alleged offender is national of that state when the victim is national of that state if that state considers it appropriate each state party shall likewise take such measures as may be necessary to establish its jurisdiction over such offences in cases where the alleged offender is present in any territory under its jurisdiction and it does not extradite him pursuant to article to any of the states mentioned in paragraph of this article this convention does not exclude any criminal jurisdiction exercised in accordance with internal law articles and of that convention also relate to the manner in which jurisdiction in criminal matters is exercised article upon being satisfied_ after an examination of information available to it_ that the circumstances so warrant_ any state party in whose territory person alleged to have committed any offence referred to in article is present shall take him into custody or take other legal measures to ensure his presence the custody and other legal measures shall be as provided in the law of that state but may be continued only for such time as is necessary to enable any criminal or extradition proceedings to be instituted such state shall immediately make preliminary inquiry into the facts any person in custody pursuant to paragraph of this article shall be assisted in communicating immediately with the nearest appropriate representative of the state of which he is national_ or_ if he is stateless person_ with the representative of the state where he usually resides when state_ pursuant to this article_ has taken person into custody_ it shall immediately notify the states referred to in article paragraph of the fact that such person is in custody and of the circumstances which warrant his detention the state which makes the preliminary inquiry contemplated in paragraph of this article shall promptly report its findings to the said states and shall indicate whether it intends to exercise jurisdiction article the state party in the territory under whose jurisdiction person alleged to have committed any offence referred to in article is found shall in the cases contemplated in article if it does not extradite him_ submit the case to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution these authorities shall take their decision in the same manner as in the case of any ordinary offence of serious nature under the law of that state in the cases referred to in article paragraph the standards of evidence required for prosecution and conviction shall in no way be less stringent than those which apply in the cases referred to in article paragraph any person regarding whom proceedings are brought in connection with any of the offences referred to in article shall be guaranteed fair treatment at all stages of the proceedings article of that convention provides for the right of victims of torture to obtain redress each state party shall ensure in its legal system that the victim of an act of torture obtains redress and has an enforceable right to fair and adequate compensation_ including the means for as full rehabilitation as possible in the event of the death of the victim as result of an act of torture_ his dependants shall be entitled to compensation nothing in this article shall affect any right of the victim or other persons to compensation which may exist under national law the travaux préparatoires in respect of article and the states declarations at the time of ratification during the deliberations in the working group accepted proposal by the netherlands to include the words committed in any territory under its jurisdiction after the expression act of torture when the convention was adopted_ however_ this phrase had disappeared_ for reasons that are unclear see manfred nowak elizabeth mcarthur_ the united nations convention against torture commentary_ oxford university press when ratifying the convention against torture the united states made the following declaration it is the understanding of the united states that article requires state party to provide private right of action for damages only for acts of torture committed in territory under the jurisdiction of the state party when submitting the bill for ratification of the convention against torture to the senate_ the president of the united states made the following remarks the negotiating history of the convention indicates that article requires state to provide private right of action for damages only for acts of torture committed in its territory_ not for acts of torture occurring abroad article was in fact adopted with express reference to the victim of an act of torture committed in any territory under its jurisdiction the italicized wording appears to have been deleted by mistake this interpretation is confirmed by the absence of discussion of the issue_ since the creation of universal right to sue would have been as controversial as was the creation of universal jurisdiction if not more so summary and analysis of the convention against torture and other cruel_ inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in message from the president of the unites states transmitting the convention against torture and other cruel_ inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment_ may th congress_ nd session_ reproduced in nowak mcarthur_ op cit pp practice of the united nations committee against torture with regard to article the united nations committee against torture_ the entity entrusted with implementing the convention against torture_ adopted general comment no on the implementation of article by states parties cat gc december in it_ the committee asserted that article does not contain any geographical limitation under the convention_ states parties are required to prosecute or extradite alleged perpetrators of torture when they are found in any territory under its jurisdiction_ and to adopt the necessary legislation to make this possible the committee considers that the application of article is not limited to victims who were harmed in the territory of the state party or by or against nationals of the state party the committee has commended the efforts of states parties for providing civil remedies for victims who were subjected to torture or ill treatment outside their territory this is particularly important when victim is unable to exercise the rights guaranteed under article in the territory where the violation took place indeed_ article requires states parties to ensure that all victims of torture and ill treatment are able to access remedy and obtain redress with regard to the practical and legal obstacles inherent in the right to redress for acts of torture_ the committee stated states parties to the convention have an obligation to ensure that the right to redress is effective specific obstacles that impede the enjoyment of the right to redress and prevent effective implementation of article include_ but are not limited to inadequate national legislation_ discrimination with regard to accessing complaints and investigation mechanisms and procedures for remedy and redress inadequate measures for securing the custody of alleged perpetrators_ state secrecy laws_ evidential burdens and procedural requirements that interfere with the determination of the right to redress statutes of limitations_ amnesties and immunities the failure to provide sufficient legal aid and protection measures for victims and witnesses as well as the associated stigma_ and the physical_ psychological and other related effects of torture and ill treatment in addition_ the failure of state party to execute judgements providing reparative measures for victim of torture_ handed down by national_ international or regional courts_ constitutes significant impediment to the right to redress states parties should develop coordinated mechanisms to enable victims to execute judgements across state lines_ including recognizing the validity of court orders from other states parties and assisting in locating the assets of perpetrators however_ in several individual communications lodged with the committee against torture_ the latter has shown more reserved attitude towards the geographical scope of article in the case of marcos roitmann rosenmann spain no the complainant argued that the handling of an extradition request against general pinochet_ then resident in the united kingdom_ was in breach of article of the convention against torture in decision of april the committee declared this complaint inadmissible for the following reasons with respect to the objection based on the committee lack of jurisdiction ratione personae the committee notes that the complainant claims with regard to torture committed by chilean authorities are ratione personae justiciable in chile and in other states in whose territory general pinochet may be found however_ to the extent that general pinochet was not in spain at the time of the submission of the communication_ the committee would consider that articles and of the convention invoked by the complainant do not apply ratione personae to spain in particular_ his right to complain to_ and to have his case promptly and impartially examined by_ the competent authorities and his claim to compensation would be justiciable vis vis the state responsible for the acts of torture_ chile_ not spain in the case of australia no decision of november the committee against torture examined an individual communication lodged by an australian citizen of chinese origin who submitted that she had been tortured by the police during visit to the people republic of china hereafter china in the period she had attempted_ unsuccessfully_ to bring civil action for compensation before the australian courts against_ inter alia_ the former president of china and member of that country communist party the action had been dismissed by the australian courts on the grounds that members of the government of foreign state enjoyed immunity the committee_ called upon to examine the case_ reiterated its approach concerning the geographical application of article of the convention against torture_ but dismissed the communication_ accepting that the state party had been unable to establish its jurisdiction for acts of torture committed outside its territory by officials of another state references omitted the committee notes the state party argument that the communication is inadmissible ratione personae under article of the convention because the communication requires the committee to consider whether china itself has violated article by allegedly not providing an effective remedy to the complainant_ and china has not made the declaration under article of the convention the committee also notes the complainant assertion that article applies irrespective of the places of the acts of torture and that_ because the australian courts have not declined jurisdiction on the ground of forum non conveniens_ the state party is required to afford an enforceable right to fair and adequate compensation the committee recalls its general comment no on the implementation of article by states parties_ in which it considers that the application of article is not limited to victims who were harmed in the territory of the state party or by or against nationals of the state party and that article requires states parties to ensure that all victims of torture and ill treatment are able to access remedy and obtain redress however_ the committee observes that_ in the specific circumstances of this case_ the state party is unable to establish jurisdiction over officials of another state for alleged acts committed outside the state party territory accordingly_ the committee considers that_ in the case under review_ the complainant claim to redress and compensation is inadmissible academic opinion on article academic opinion is divided on the question whether article of the convention against torture has extra territorial jurisdiction in the opinion of certain commentators_ this provision does not lay down an obligation to exercise universal jurisdiction_ but equally it does not prohibit states_ in the light of paragraph and of the object and purpose of the convention_ from providing for such possibility see nowak mcarthur_ op cit et seq and kate parlett_ universal civil jurisdiction for torture_ european human rights law review_ issue pp other authors argue that article does apply to acts of torture committed abroad_ given that it provides for no geographical limitation see christopher keith hall_ the duty of states parties to the convention against torture to provide procedures permitting victims to recover reparations for torture committed abroad_ european journal of international law_ vol no nov pp and alexander orakhelashvili_ state immunity and hierarchy of norm why the house of lords got it wrong_ european journal of international law_ vol no nov pp still other commentators consider that no inference can be drawn from article as to whether state party is obliged to make available to victims of torture

yearbook of international law_ vol pp the united nations convention relating to the status of refugees the united nations convention relating to the status of refugees of july entered into force on

international law to secure the right to access justice and fair and impartial proceedings shall be reflected in domestic laws ix reparation for harm effective and prompt reparation is intended to promote justice by redressing gross violations of international human rights law or serious violations of international humanitarian law reparation should be proportional to the gravity of the violations and the harm suffered in accordance with its domestic laws and international legal obligations_ state shall provide reparation to victims for acts or omissions which can be attributed to the state and constitute gross violations of international human rights law or serious violations of international humanitarian law in cases where person_ legal person_ or other entity is found liable for reparation to victim_ such party should provide reparation to the victim or compensate the state if the state has already provided reparation to the victim states should endeavour to establish national programmes for reparation and other assistance to victims in the event that the parties liable for the harm suffered are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations states shall_ with respect to claims by victims_ enforce domestic judgements for reparation against individuals or entities liable for the harm suffered and endeavour to enforce valid foreign legal judgements for reparation in accordance with domestic law and international legal obligations to that end_ states should provide under their domestic laws effective mechanisms for the enforcement of reparation judgements in accordance with domestic law and international law_ and taking account of individual circumstances_ victims of gross violations of international human rights law and serious violations of international humanitarian law should_ as appropriate and proportional to the gravity of the violation and the circumstances of each case_ be provided with full and effective reparation_ as laid out in principles to which include the following forms restitution_ compensation_ rehabilitation_ satisfaction and guarantees of non repetition the work of the institute of international law on universal civil jurisdiction with regard to reparation for international crimes on august the institute of international law hereafter the iil adopted at its tallinn session resolution entitled universal civil jurisdiction with regard to reparation for international crimes it is worded as follows resolution the institute of international law_conscious that appropriate and effective reparation has to be provided for the harm suffered by the victims of international crimes considering that international crimes means serious crimes under international law such as genocide_ torture and other crimes against humanity_ and war crimes recalling that universal criminal jurisdiction is means of preventing the commission of such crimes and to avoid their impunity_ as affirmed in the krakow resolution on universal criminal jurisdiction with regard to the crime of genocide_ crimes against humanity and war crimes noting that the prosecution of the authors of international crimes and their punishment provides only partial satisfaction to the victims considering that universal civil jurisdiction is means of avoiding the deprivation of the victims of international crimes to obtain reparation of the harm suffered_ in particular because the courts ordinarily having jurisdiction do not provide for an appropriate remedy adopts the following resolution article victims of international crimes have right to appropriate and effective reparation from persons liable for the injury they have right to an effective access to justice to claim reparation these rights do not depend on any criminal conviction of the author of the crime article court should exercise jurisdiction over claims for reparation by victims provided that no other state has stronger connections with the claim_ taking into account the connection with the victims and the defendants and the relevant facts and circumstances or even though one or more other states have such stronger connections_ such victims do not have available remedies in the courts of any such other state for the purposes of paragraph courts shall be considered to provide an available remedy if they have jurisdiction and if they are capable of dealing with the claim in compliance with the requirements of due process and of providing remedies that afford appropriate and effective redress the court where claims for relief by victims have been brought should decline to entertain the claims or suspend the proceedings_ in view of the circumstances_ when the victims claims have also been brought before an international jurisdiction_ such as the international criminal court an authority for conciliation or indemnification established under international law or the court of another state having stronger connections and available remedies within the meaning of the foregoing paragraphs article states should see that the legal and financial obstacles facing victims and their representatives are kept to minimum in the course of procedures relating to claims for reparation article states should endeavour to develop procedures to allow groups of victims to present claims for reparation article the immunity of states should not deprive victims of their right to reparation article it is recommended that in the course of the preparation of an instrument on jurisdiction and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters_ in particular by the hague conference on private international law_ the rights of victims as set out in these articles be taken into account in his background report to this resolution yearbook of the institute of international law_ tallinn session_ justitia et pace_ vol pp the rapporteur andreas bucher argues that article of the convention against torture does not impose universal civil jurisdiction in the area of international crimes_ in the following terms the cited provisions do not define the connection that victim must have with state in order to be able to benefit from its system for reparation equally_ they do not indicate that even victims who have no connection with the territory of state may apply in it for compensation in respect of acts of torture sustained elsewhere admittedly_ it is evident that the obligation to put in place compensation system lies on the state responsible for acts of torture_ and on the state in which such acts were prepared or on the territory of which the torturers have attempted to obtain refuge however_ the system recommended by the convention against torture does not impose on state an obligation to provide reparation in respect of acts having no connection with that state or for victims whose protection does not fall within its sphere of interest_ whether that is expressed in terms of jurisdictional criteria_ political stakes_ or in any other manner in other words_ the convention does not require that state endow its courts with universal civil jurisdiction moreover_ we note that in articles to the convention against torture defines its criminal scope in detail this international criminal jurisdiction is not universal_ although it might be thought that its effects appear to be so however_ even if this were correct_ one cannot assign similar scope to article on the obligation to provide redress_ which is worded in terms that are significantly more general and thus less binding on the states parties nor does this difference in the texts allow for the conclusion that the system for civil jurisdiction ought to be defined in parallel with the grounds for criminal jurisdiction mere affirmation that these two systems for redress would be complementary is insufficient to overcome the difference between them as that was intended by the authors of the convention the relevant work of the institute of international law and the international law association on the forum of necessity the background report to the resolution adopted by the iil in mentioned above see paragraph also refers to the concept of the forum of necessity it argues that this concept is not generally accepted by the states_ as follows the idea of accepting forum of necessity with so many clarifications would require implementation at the level of private international law_ whether national or international in source as matters currently stand_ it is not possible to derive such solution from general international law in particular_ its adoption conflicts with the fact that the concept of forum of necessity_ like that of denial of justice_ is not generally accepted in the various legal systems in addition_ referring to the present case as judged before the swiss courts_ the rapporteur notes the lack of precision in the criteria used by the domestic legal orders_ such as sufficient connection or connection with the dispute indeed_ attention should be drawn to the lack of clarity surrounding use of the criterion of sufficient connection with the forum state or connection with the dispute especially with regard to provision as it exists in switzerland and quebec its indeterminacy creates risk that it will be misunderstood and interpreted to the detriment of victims legitimate interests this has been confirmed by judgment of the swiss federal court_ refusing to accept forum of necessity in the case of tunisian national_ resident with his family for ten years in switzerland_ where he had obtained political asylum_ and who was claiming reparation for non pecuniary damage from the republic of tunisia on account of torture experienced in the premises of the ministry of the interior in tunisia in at the end of purely literal interpretation_ it was concluded that the forum of necessity could not be recognised_ since it required sufficient connection with the facts of the case while the connection with the claimant person was not decisive at its sofia session in the committee on international civil litigation and the interests of the public of the international law association hereafter_ the ila adopted resolution no this resolution addresses problems of coordination between different jurisdictions and is limited to claims against individuals_ corporations and other non state actors see paragraph below among the elements which could serve as grounds for state jurisdiction_ the resolution proposes_ inter alia_ the forum of necessity the relevant paragraphs are worded as follows scope these guidelines apply to civil claims against corporations_ individuals and other non state actors arising out of or brought to redress conduct constituting human rights violation_ in view of the nature of the norm allegedly violated or the gross or systematic nature of the breach alleged forum of necessity the courts of any state with sufficient connection to the dispute shall have jurisdiction in order to avert denial of justice denial of justice in the sense of paragraph occurs if the court concludes upon hearing all interested parties_ and after taking account of reliable public sources of information_ that no other court is available or the claimant cannot reasonably be expected to seize another court sufficient connection in the sense of paragraph consists in particular in the presence of the claimant the nationality of the claimant or the defendant the presence of assets of the defendant some activity of the defendant or civil claim based on an act giving rise to criminal proceedings in the court seized of those proceedings_ to the extent that that court has jurisdiction under its own law to entertain civil proceedings iv comparative law material the court has updated the comparative law analysis that was prepared for the chamber see paragraphs of the chamber judgment the updated version takes into account member states of the council of europe albania_ armenia_ austria_ azerbaijan_ belgium_ bosnia and herzegovina_ bulgaria_ the czech republic_ estonia_ finland_ france_ georgia_ germany_ greece_ hungary_ ireland_ iceland_ italy_ latvia_ liechtenstein_ lithuania_ luxembourg_ malta_ moldova_ monaco_ the netherlands_ norway_ poland_ portugal_ romania_ russia_ san marino_ serbia_ slovakia_ slovenia_ spain_ turkey_ ukraine and the united kingdom and also certain states which are not members of the council of europe universal jurisdiction for civil actions to obtain compensation for damage sustained as result of torture in the context of the comparative law research_ the court analysed the situation in the various states with regard to universal jurisdiction for civil actions to obtain compensation for damage sustained as result of acts of torture council of europe member states it follows from the above mentioned study that_ of the european states included in the analysis_ only the netherlands recognise universal civil jurisdiction in respect of acts of torture in the akpan case judgment of january case no ha the district court of the hague found against subsidiary of the dutch company shell_ holding that it had breached its responsibility to protect the ogoni people in nigeria in the course of its petroleum extraction activities the parent company was also subject to an obligation to provide protection under nigerian law_ but it was found that_ in this particular case_ the conditions for applying that obligation were not met previously_ in the el hojouj amer derbas and others case judgment of march case no ha the same court had awarded damages to palestinian doctor who had been tortured by libyan officials the other contracting states studied do not recognise universal international jurisdiction before the civil courts_ whether for acts of torture or for other criminal acts or offences in italy_ for example_ there is neither provision of positive law nor clear case law conferring on the civil courts universal jurisdiction for compensation claims in cases of torture and crimes against humanity however_ part of italian academic opinion considers that certain decisions by the italian courts may be moving in the direction of recognising such jurisdiction these include the court of cassation judgment in the ferrini case november march concerning germany liability for the claimant arrest in italy and his deportation to germany during the second world war in the context of those proceedings_ the court of cassation placed particular emphasis in its reasoning on the need to ensure respect for jus cogens as fundamental value of the international community reference should also be made to series of subsequent judgments delivered by the italian courts against germany in the period one of those judgments declared enforceable in italy judgment by greek court which ordered germany to compensate the victims of the distomo greece massacre of june these italian judgments were the subject of the judgment by the international court of justice hereafter_ the icj of february in the case on jurisdictional immunities of the state germany italy greece intervening judgment_ icj reports which found that italy had breached customary international law guaranteeing states jurisdictional immunity in the united kingdom_ in the case of jones saudi arabia ukhl the house of lords held that article of the convention against torture did not provide for universal civil jurisdiction_ and that there was no evidence that states had recognised an international law obligation to exercise universal jurisdiction over claims arising from alleged breaches of peremptory norms of international law equally_ there was no consensus of judicial and learned opinion that they should the house of lords distinguished the jones case from another case previously examined by it_ namely pinochet no ex parte pinochet ugarte no ac concerning the former chilean dictator_ on the grounds_ specifically_ that the pinochet case concerned criminal proceedings which fell squarely within the universal jurisdiction mandated by the convention against torture see of the judgment the house of lords thus found no reason to set aside the applicability of the rule laying down absolute state immunity for acts committed by their representatives acting in their official capacity that case subsequently came before this court_ which held that there had been no violation of article of the convention see jones and others the united kingdom_ nos and echr in recent judgment in the case of belhaj and another straw and others uksc lord mance and lord sumption reiterated the findings of the house of lords with regard to the non existence of universal civil jurisdiction for acts of torture non member states of the council of europe turning to non member states of the council of europe_ the court notes that the canadian courts enjoy universal jurisdiction in examining civil claims but solely in cases concerning terrorism_ under the justice for victims of terrorism act however_ this jurisdiction is subject to the condition that the victim is canadian citizen or is permanent resident of canada_ or that the civil action has real and substantial connection to canada in contrast_ universal jurisdiction does not apply to actions in respect of damage sustained as result of other violations of international law_ including torture_ except where it is shown that it took place in the context of acts of terrorism in the case of bouzari islamic republic of iran dlr th the ontario court of appeal held that article of the un convention against torture did not impose an obligation on canada to ensure civil law remedies for acts of torture committed outside its territory in the case of kazemi succession the islamic republic of iran scc the supreme court of canada_ noting the absence of state practice and of opinio juris_ held that canada was not obliged to open its courts so that its citizens could seek civil redress for acts of torture committed abroad of all the states included in the present survey_ only the united states provides_ at federal level_ for universal jurisdiction in respect of civil claims for compensation with regard to damage sustained as result of torture_ on the basis of two federal laws the alien tort statute and the torture victim protection act the first ascribes jurisdiction to the federal courts for any civil action by an alien for tort only_ committed in violation of the law of nations or treaty of the united states in other words_ it is not necessary that the impugned act was committed in the territory of the united states or by national of that state the first significant application of the alien tort statute was in the landmark case of filártiga peña irala_ examined before the second circuit court of appeals in cir in that case_ the court accepted the complaint by the parents of victim who had been tortured to death in paraguay the complaint was brought against the perpetrator of the impugned acts_ who was then resident in the united states the court found that federal jurisdiction could be exercised whenever an alleged torturer was found and served with process by an alien within the borders of the united states ibid at the torture victim protection act provides as follows an individual who_ under actual or apparent authority_ or color of law_ of any foreign nation subjects an individual to torture shall_ in civil action_ be liable for damages to that individual section it is clear from these two laws that cases can_ priori_ be submitted to the courts of the united states without there being jurisdictional link with that country for court to be entitled to take action on case_ the person against whom the claim is brought must nonetheless fall within the jurisdiction of the united states at the time that the action is lodged furthermore_ even where the court jurisdiction is accepted_ there exist other legal obstacles in reality_ it seems that about of the cases brought under those two acts have been dismissed on various grounds_ such as the act of state doctrine_ sovereign immunity or the forum non conveniens doctrine see nowak mcarthur_ op cit moreover_ limitations have been placed on the scope of the alien tort statute in recent years in the case of kiobel royal dutch petroleum co nigerian nationals who had obtained refugee status in the united states applied to the american courts under the alien tort statute_ alleging that dutch_ british and nigerian companies had aided and abetted violations of international law committed by the nigerian government kiobel royal dutch petroleum co ct on april the us supreme court ruled as follows we therefore conclude that the presumption against applies to claims under the ats_ and that nothing in the statute rebuts that presumption here is no clear indication of here_ morrison_ at slip op at and petitioners case seeking relief for violations of the law of nations occurring outside the united states is barred ivon these facts_ all the relevant conduct took place out side the united states and even where the claims touch and concern the territory of the united states_ they must do so with sufficient force to displace the presumption against application see morrison_ slip op at corporations are often present in many countries_ and it would reach too far to say that mere corporate presence suffices if congress were to determine otherwise_ statute more specific than the ats would be required possibility of joining criminal proceedings as civil party the question of the civil courts universal jurisdiction must be distinguished from the possibility of applying to join the proceedings as civil party in criminal proceedings brought before the criminal courts on the basis of the principle of universal jurisdiction in criminal matters several states provide for this possibility including belgium_ spain_ france_ ireland_ norway_ the czech republic and slovenia thus_ in belgium the universal jurisdiction of the national criminal courts is governed by article bis of the preliminary part of the code of criminal procedure_ introduced by the law of august this article enables the belgian criminal courts to extend their jurisdiction to include offences that do not have connection with the national territory_ either in application of rule of international law as provided for by the convention against torture or in application of rule of customary international law as regards the crime of genocide and crimes against humanity equally_ the judicature act in spain provides for the universal criminal jurisdiction of the spanish courts for certain crimes_ including crimes against humanity and acts of torture_ committed in other states by spanish citizens or by non nationals_ subject to certain conditions in the context of criminal proceedings_ the victims of crimes may join the proceedings as civil party and claim redress in respect of the damage sustained article of the code of criminal procedure in france_ the code of criminal procedure allows criminal charges to be brought against persons responsible for acts of torture and other cruel_ inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment_ even when committed outside french territory_ and to try them before french courts if those persons are present in france in such cases_ the civil party proceedings can be joined to the public prosecution in ireland the legislation also recognises universal criminal jurisdiction in respect of torture and crimes against humanity_ and the general national scheme of compensation for victims of crime applies in principle to cases examined by the irish courts on that basis however_ there is no practical example to date of such compensation being awarded by the criminal injuries compensation tribunal the forum of necessity geographical scope the court comparative law analysis has shown that the rules governing universal civil jurisdiction in eleven of the european states considered austria_ belgium_ estonia_ france_ germany_ luxembourg_ the netherlands_ norway_ poland_ portugal and romania explicitly recognise either the forum of necessity or principle bearing another name but entailing very similar if not identical consequences as in the case of france including switzerland_ there are therefore twelve states in this category among the non member states of the council of europe_ the forum of necessity is recognised by the civil code of quebec in canada but the domestic case law has recently introduced it into the domestic law of some other canadian provinces in eight of these states_ the forum of necessity is provided for by law austria_ belgium_ estonia_ the netherlands_ poland_ portugal_ romania and switzerland even if it was in some instances initially defined by the case law and subsequently enacted in law by the legislature quebec also comes within this category in the four other states france_ germany_ luxembourg and norway the forum of necessity is creation of case law_ and has not been enacted into law by the legislature the same is true in respect of canada except for quebec in france_ private international law does not include the jurisdictional principle of forum of necessity as such in some rare cases_ however_ the national courts have held_ on the basis of international public policy and in order to avoid denial of justice_ that they have jurisdiction applicability ratione materiae as to the types of dispute to which the principle of the forum of necessity applies_ the court notes that in all of the states studied which recognise this concept_ the forum of necessity is applied_ barring the occasional exception_ without distinction being made on the basis of the nature of the dispute it seems_ however_ that this forum is primarily applied in the areas of family law or contract law it does not appear that the courts in these member states have been required to rule on case similar to the present one_ that is_ concerning civil action to obtain compensation for damage sustained as result of torture conditions of application as to the conditions of application of the forum of necessity_ the court observes that in all the states which recognise this principle whether it has been established by case law or codified by the legislature its application is always subject to two cumulative conditions_ namely_ the de facto or de jure impossibility of bringing the dispute before the courts of another state_ and the existence of at least certain proximity or at least certain connection between the dispute and the state of the forum applied to with regard to the first condition_ the court observes that the forum of necessity is by nature subsidiary_ and that it enters into play where examination of the case by the courts of another state is de jure or de facto impossible_ or is unreasonably difficult with regard to the second condition_ namely the existence of certain connection between the dispute and the forum state in question_ the court notes that the relevant legislative provisions require either close ties as in belgium and estonia or sufficient poland_ romania or sufficiently strong ties portugal without further precision identification of the relevant connection and of its effective existence is carried out in the specific circumstances of the case by the domestic court before which it is brought the factors which indicate connection accepted by the courts may vary depending on the nature of the dispute or the identity of the parties legal entities_ natural persons distinction between forum of necessity and forum non conveniens the court further notes that in those states and territories with legal system based on the anglo american tradition_ the question of forum of necessity is not posed in the same terms the broad scope of judicial power leads the courts to set limits on it these limits are the equivalent of the grounds of jurisdiction in the civil law tradition_ in that they determine the cases that may be heard and determined by the courts in the majority of cases_ therefore_ the aim is not to resolve conflict as to proper jurisdiction by allowing for an additional or exceptional forum_ but_ conversely_ to prevent too broad an exercise of judicial power at international level to this end_ an exception known as the forum non conveniens has been developed under this exception national court can decline jurisdiction on the grounds that court with equal jurisdiction_ situated in another state_ would_ objectively speaking_ be more appropriate forum for examining dispute_ that is_ before which the dispute could be suitably settled_ for the interests of all parties and for the ends of justice see house of lords judgment in spiliada maritime corporation cansulex ltd_ ac esp the concept of denial of justice is relevant only for ensuring that the court before which forum non conveniens claim is brought does not relinquish jurisdiction without verifying that an alternative forum exists european union law the court also considers it appropriate to refer to certain relevant elements of european union law the recast version of the brussels regulation known as brussels bis introduced by regulation eu no of the european parliament and of the council of december on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters recast in force since january does not provide for forum of necessity however_ the forum of necessity is explicitly recognised in three special regulations covering certain fields which are excluded from the scope of the brussels bis regulation pursuant to article thus_ article of regulation eu no of the european parliament and of the council of july on jurisdiction_ applicable law_ recognition and enforcement of decisions and acceptance and enforcement of authentic instruments in matters of succession and on the creation of european certificate of succession explicitly provides for forum of necessity in the following terms article forum necessitatis where no court of member state has jurisdiction pursuant to other provisions of this regulation_ the courts of member state may_ on an exceptional basis_ rule on the succession if proceedings cannot reasonably be brought or conducted or would be impossible in third state with which the case is closely connected the case must have sufficient connection with the member state of the court seised furthermore_ similar provision is contained in article of council regulation ec no of december on jurisdiction_ applicable law_ recognition and enforcement of decisions and cooperation in matters relating to maintenance obligations this is also the case with regard to article of council regulation eu of june implementing enhanced cooperation in the area of jurisdiction_ applicable law and the recognition and enforcement of decisions in matters of matrimonial regimes however_ it should be noted that none of these texts provides more specific information on the nature of this connection identification of the relevant connection and the effective existence of sufficient connection are left in each case to the assessment of the domestic court

lodged in the context of the armed conflict that occurred between georgia and the russian federation in august following an extended period of ever mounting tensions_ provocations and incidents between the two countries the facts of the case may be summarised as follows overview in its report of september the independent international fact finding mission on the conflict in georgia iiffmcg hereafter the eu fact finding mission established by decision of december of the council of the european union_ described the armed conflict in the following terms on the night of to august after an extended period of ever mounting tensions and incidents_ heavy fighting erupted in and around the town of tskhinvali in south ossetia the fighting_ which soon extended to other parts of georgia_ lasted for five days in many places throughout the country it caused serious destruction_ reaching levels of utter devastation in number of towns and villages human losses were substantial at the end_ the georgian side claimed losses of servicemen_ policemen and civilians killed and persons wounded the russian side claimed losses of servicemen killed and wounded the south ossetians spoke of persons killed_ which probably included both servicemen and civilians altogether about persons lost their lives_ not to mention those who were wounded_ who went missing_ or the far more than civilians who fled their homes around still have not been able to return to their homes the fighting did not end the political conflict nor were any of the issues that lay beneath it resolved tensions still continue the political situation after the end of fighting turned out to be no easier and in some respects even more difficult than before the eu fact finding mission also summarised the course of the events in question as follows pp on the night of to august sustained georgian artillery attack struck the town of tskhinvali other movements of the georgian armed forces targeting tskhinvali and the surrounding areas were under way_ and soon the fighting involved russian_ south ossetian and abkhaz military units and armed elements it did not take long_ however_ before the georgian advance into south ossetia was stopped in counter movement_ russian armed forces_ covered by air strikes and by elements of its black sea fleet_ penetrated deep into georgia_ cutting across the country main east west road_ reaching the port of poti and stopping short of georgia capital city_ tbilisi the confrontation developed into combined inter state and intra state conflict_ opposing georgian and russian forces at one level of confrontation as well as south ossetians together with abkhaz fighters and the georgians at another such combination of conflicts going on at different levels is particularly prone to violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law this is indeed what happened_ and many of these instances were due to the action of irregular armed groups on the south ossetian side that would not or could not be adequately controlled by regular russian armed forces then another theatre of hostility opened on the western flank_ where abkhaz forces supported by russian forces took the upper kodori valley_ meeting with little georgian resistance after five days of fighting_ ceasefire agreement was negotiated on august between russian president dmitry medvedev_ georgian president mikheil saakashvili and french president nicolas sarkozy_ the latter acting on behalf of the european union an implementation agreement followed on september again largely due to the persistent efforts of the french president chronology of the conflict in the light of all the material in the court possession_ the chronology of the conflict may be summarised as follows in the night of to august after an extended period of ever mounting tensions and incidents_ georgian artillery attacked tskhinvali administrative capital of south ossetia from august russian ground forces penetrated into georgia by crossing through abkhazia and south ossetia before penetrating into the neighbouring regions in undisputed georgian territory they were assisted by the russian air

to the south of south ossetia from august the georgian armed forces withdrew from the tskhinvali region and then from the gori district the russian armed forces progressively invaded the following georgian territories all of abkhazia_ including upper abkhazia upper kodori valley formerly under georgian control ii all of south ossetia_ including the akhalgori district_ formerly under georgian control that district was occupied from august iii the village of perevi sachkhere district situated in undisputed georgian territory_ to the west of south ossetia iv the buffer zone including the zones bordering south ossetia and abkhazia_ situated in undisputed georgian territory_ after the russian armed forces had withdrawn from the town of gori on august ceasefire agreement was concluded on august between the russian federation and georgia under the auspices of the european union_ providing_ inter alia_ that the parties would refrain from the use of force immediately end hostilities provide access for humanitarian aid and that georgian military forces would withdraw to their usual bases and russian military forces to the lines prior to the outbreak of hostilities by decree of august the russian president_ dmitry medvedev_ recognised south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states following unanimous vote of the russian federal assembly to that end that recognition was not followed by the international community owing to the delay by the russian federation in applying that agreement_ new agreement implementing the ceasefire agreement sarkozy medvedev agreement was signed on september it provided_ inter alia_ that the russian federation would withdraw its troops from the zones bordering abkhazia and south ossetia within days of deployment of the eu observation mission on october on september russia signed friendship and cooperation agreements with south ossetia and abkhazia in respect of number of areas those agreements provided for the establishment of military bases and the stationing of up to russian soldiers in each of those two regions the two agreements were unanimously ratified by the state duma on october and by the federation council on november on october russia completed the withdrawal of its troops stationed in the buffer zone except for the village of perevi sachkhere district situated in undisputed georgian territory_ from which the russian troops did not withdraw until october relevant international humanitarian law the hague regulations of the hague regulations concerning the laws and customs of war on land of october contain_ inter alia_ relevant provisions in situations of occupation geneva conventions of and additional protocol the conventions and additional protocol relevant to the present case are the following the first geneva convention convention for the amelioration of the condition of the wounded and sick in armed forces in the field adopted in and revised in and ii the third geneva convention convention iii relative to the treatment of prisoners of war adopted in and revised in iii the fourth geneva convention convention iv relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war of august and iv the additional protocol to the geneva conventions protocol relating to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts_ adopted on june article of each of these conventions requires the contracting parties to undertake to respect and to ensure respect for the present convention in all circumstances requests of the partiesthe applicant government the applicant government submitted that on the basis of the available evidence the violations of the convention fall within the jurisdiction of the russian federation under article of the convention because it exercised effective authority and control over the relevant areas where the violations took place and or exercised jurisdiction through state agent authority and control the violations form part of repetitive pattern of acts and omissions that amount to an administrative practice incompatible with the convention_ which have been perpetrated by russian authorities or the subject of official tolerance by russian authorities and that in any event_ no effective remedies exist having regard to the approach adopted by the russian authorities to investigation of the violations at issue russia has violated articles and of the convention_ articles and of protocol to the convention and article of protocol to the convention and has failed to carry out investigations into the incidents forming the basis of these violations having regard to the evidence relied upon_ the applicant government asked the court to acknowledge that russia had infringed the above mentioned provisions and had failed to carry out an investigation into the incidents giving rise to those infringements the applicant government also sought just satisfaction for these violations_ including convention compliant investigations_ remedial measures and compensation to the injured parties the respondent government the respondent government challenged georgia application for the following reasons georgia allegations relate to alleged events that took place outside the jurisdiction of the russian federation and outside russia effective control accordingly_ georgia complaints_ aside from being specious and contrived_ relate to matters outside the jurisdiction of the court georgia case relates substantially to alleged conduct of russian armed forces in an armed conflict and the immediate aftermath of an armed conflict which georgia started by its attack upon south ossetia and russian peacekeepers and nationals in south ossetia russia military response was legitimate under public international law and ihl international humanitarian law in the international armed conflict that resulted_ russia obligations were defined and governed exclusively by ihl_ and the court has no jurisdiction over the relevant questions of russia compliance with ihl without prejudice to that position_ russia complied fully with ihl georgia allegations of human rights abuses and russian responsibility for them are false on the facts and lack evidential support the limited evidence that has been put before the court by georgia is not proper basis for the serious charges levelled against russian forces to the extent that georgians were injured or their property damaged outside areas of active conflict and georgia vastly exaggerates the instances the perpetrators appear to have been south ossetians including rogue militia members_ disaffected south ossetian civilians and criminals as regards georgia complaints of inconvenience to georgian nationals from the maintenance of border controls_ those controls are the exclusive responsibility of the south ossetian and abkhazian governments georgian nationals have remedies in south ossetia and abkhazia they also have capacity to bring cases in russia however_ georgia has failed consistently to engage with or provide assistance to criminal investigations in south ossetia_ abkhazia and russia the primary submission of the respondent government was that the court should reject georgia application because it is premised on russia having effective control over areas of conflict and subsequent civil disorder_ where it should be apparent even at this stage that russia did not have effective control it is premised upon alleged breaches of convention law where ihl_ exclusively_ applied if the court is minded to go yet further_ the russian federation respectfully submits that it will be necessary for the court to make arrangements to receive evidence and for the evidence to be appropriately tested_ including by cross examination it will also be necessary to take into account evidence from individual applications which bears on the facts in dispute in view of the foregoing_ while reconfirming its objections on jurisdiction and admissibility in the present case_ the respondent government alternatively respectfully requested that the application be dismissed on the merits in full
 HANAN v. GERMANY,the factsthe background to the case the applicant was born in omar khel_ afghanistan_ and lives there following the attacks of september the united states_ together with the united kingdom_ launched military operations in afghanistan on october called operation enduring freedom_ these operations included the destruction of terrorist training camps and infrastructure_ as well as the capture of al qaeda leaders_ and drove the taliban from power on november the german parliament authorised the deployment of up to german soldiers as part of operation enduring freedom the contingent included around soldiers of the german special forces_ who were subsequently involved in operations in afghanistan in the beginning of december twenty five prominent afghan leaders met in bonn under the auspices of the united nations to decide on plan for governing the country they set up an afghan interim authority and chose its leader in the agreement of december the bonn agreement as to which see paragraph below the participants at the conference requested the assistance of the international community in maintaining security in afghanistan and envisaged the establishment of an international security assistance force isaf on december the united nations security council authorised the establishment of isaf isaf was to assist the afghan interim authority in maintaining security in kabul and surrounding areas and to enable the interim authority and the united nations to operate in safe environment while isaf mainly focused on maintaining security_ the forces engaged in operation enduring freedom continued to carry out and counter insurgency operations on december the german parliament authorised the deployment of german armed forces as part of isaf see paragraph below on august nato assumed command of isaf and subsequently isaf mission was expanded beyond the kabul area by the end of isaf was responsible for all of afghanistan after nato assumed command of isaf_ isaf headquarters isaf hq and the commander of isaf comisaf were placed under the command of the nato allied joint force command and of the nato supreme allied commander europe under isaf hq were five regional commands rcs which coordinated all regional civil military activities conducted by the military elements of the provincial reconstruction teams prts in their respective areas of responsibility while isaf hq comisaf retained operational control_ the prts were placed under the command in the form of tactical control of the respective regional command german troops were deployed under rc north_ which was led by germany at the relevant time_ the commander of rc north was the german brigadier general prt kunduz_ which was part of rc north_ was commanded by the german colonel parallel to the command structure of isaf_ disciplinary and administrative command and control remained with the respective troop contributing states see paragraph below therefore the deployed troops in prt kunduz were in that regard under the command and control of colonel who himself was under the command and control of brigadier general the latter also commanded the entire german isaf contingent in afghanistan and was placed via the commander of the bundeswehr joint forces operations command under the command of the federal ministry of defence at the relevant time rc north consisted of approximately troops_ of which were german soldiers around soldiers were stationed at prt kunduz including two german special operations units after april the security situation in kunduz province deteriorated particularly during the elections in august and september an increased number of attacks on isaf troops occurred_ which resulted in several casualties according to statement made by colonel before german parliamentary commission of inquiry_ the troops had had to expect attacks whenever they left their base the circumstances of the casethe air strike of september on september insurgents hijacked two fuel tankers_ killing one of the two drivers later that day the fuel tankers became immobilised on sand bank in the kunduz river_ around seven kilometres from the base of prt kunduz to mobilise the fuel tankers again_ the insurgents enlisted the population of nearby villages to siphon off some of the fuel from them at around an informant tipped off prt kunduz about the hijacking of the fuel tankers at around prt kunduz was formally informed of the event at an aircraft previously tasked with another operation was instructed to locate the fuel tankers at around the tankers were spotted by the surveillance aircraft the video footage transmitted from the aircraft to the command centre showed the two tankers as well as several vehicles next to the bank and numerous persons in the course of the night_ captain who was present at the command centre along with staff sergeants and repeatedly went to see the interpreter on duty in order to obtain direct information from the informant and or to transmit questions from colonel to the informant_ who had first informed prt kunduz of the hijacking at around the informant reported the partial emptying of the tankers by the armed insurgents_ as well as the absence of civilians at the sand bank the informant description corresponded to the conditions that could be discerned on the video footage at the surveillance aircraft ran low on fuel and returned to its base shortly thereafter_ staff sergeant contacted isaf hq to request replacement aircraft he was told that air support could be provided only if troops in contact situation was declared_ that is_ if isaf troops were in actual contact with insurgents at around colonel declared troops in contact even though there had been no enemy contact in the literal sense of the term_ and two united states air force usaf aircraft were ordered to the riverbank_ where the fuel tankers were still stuck and continued to be siphoned off the aircraft reached the air space above the sand bank at around discussions between the pilots and the command centre ensued about the use of pound or pound bombs and the potential damage to civilian objects near the sand bank in response to colonel repeated queries_ the informant confirmed that only insurgents and no civilians were present near the sand bank after refusing suggestions by the pilots to make show of force by flying at low altitude over the tankers to disperse the people on the ground_ colonel gave the order to bomb the still immobilised fuel tankers two pound bombs were dropped at first post attack reconnaissance was performed by the usaf aircraft immediately after their air strike in addition_ an unmanned aircraft inspected the site of the air strike at around the following morning the air strike destroyed the two fuel tankers and killed_ inter alios_ the applicant two sons abdul bayan and nesarullah they were and years old_ respectively the total number of victims of the air strike has never been established see paragraphs and below the german government made ex gratia payments of united states dollars per person to the families of killed individuals and to eleven injured persons investigations into the air strikeon site investigation later on that same morning_ after being informed of the air strike_ brigadier general sent an investigation team of the german military police feldjäger from masar sharif to kunduz to support prt kunduz in the investigation into the air strike at on the same day_ team from prt kunduz departed for the site of the air strike_ which it reached at no members of the team from masar sharif_ which had left from their base at and had not yet arrived at the base of prt kunduz_ participated in the on site visit the team from prt kunduz came across an extensively altered site_ with only few destroyed cars and no bodies during the visit_ the team_ who were afforded protection by some one hundred members of the afghan security forces_ came under attack_ but managed to continue investigating after returning fire after the team return to the base at an evaluation meeting was held from onwards_ which involved colonel and members of the military police team deployed from masar sharif_ who had arrived in the meantime on and september members of prt kunduz_ the military police and the isaf initial action team see paragraph below visited hospitals and villages in the area and interviewed several persons regarding the air strike colonel was partially involved in some interviews and was kept up to date regarding the investigation the military police submitted their report to brigadier general on september investigation by the german public prosecution authorities on the day of the air strike_ the chief legal officer of the armed forces informed the public prosecutor office in potsdam where the bundeswehr operations command is located of the air strike on september the public prosecutor office in potsdam launched preliminary investigation_ which was later transferred to the public prosecutor office in leipzig the then duty station of colonel and subsequently to the dresden public prosecutor general the prosecution authority superior to the leipzig public prosecutor after further preparatory work_ which included exchanges with the federal ministry of defence concerning the legal framework of the military deployment in afghanistan and the potential existence of an exculpatory defence on november the dresden public prosecutor general requested the office of the federal prosecutor general to review the possibility of taking over the prosecution of the case in the light of possible liability under the code of crimes against international law see paragraphs and below by this time_ the federal prosecutor general office was already in the process of establishing whether it had competence_ having initiated preliminary investigation on september as to the course of the investigation_ the federal prosecutor general_ by letter of november asked the bundeswehr operations command to forward all findings of fact relevant to the air strike in question for further clarification three days later the bundeswehr operations command forwarded considerable number of reports it provided further additional documentation on december by letter of december the federal prosecutor general asked for copies of the files presented to the parliamentary commission of inquiry see paragraph below which were subsequently provided to him he also received copies of the transcripts of the commission hearings on december the federal prosecutor general sent comprehensive catalogue of questions to the bundeswehr operations command_ which were answered in letter dated february on february letter with additional questions was addressed to the german federal ministry of defence_ which responded to these on march on the basis of the factual findings up to that point_ the federal prosecutor general opened criminal investigation against colonel and staff sergeant who had assisted colonel on the night of the air strike from to march the federal prosecutor general questioned the two suspects and interviewed two witnesses captain and staff sergeant who had been present at the command centre of the base in kunduz at the relevant time moreover_ the collection of documents and the video material from the aircraft were analysed on april the federal prosecutor general discontinued the criminal investigation due to lack of sufficient grounds for suspicion that the suspects had incurred criminal liability under either the code of crimes against international law or the criminal code he determined that the situation in afghanistan at the material time_ at least in the northern part of the country where the german armed forces were deployed_ amounted to non international armed conflict within the meaning of international humanitarian law_ notwithstanding the involvement of international troops he concluded that afghanistan had consented to the isaf deployment in manner valid under international law and isaf was fighting on behalf of the afghan authorities the taliban insurgency and the groups affiliated thereto_ described in detail in the discontinuation decision_ were to be classified as party to the conflict under international law the existence of this non international armed conflict triggered the applicability of international humanitarian law see also article of the basic law_ cited in paragraph below and of the code of crimes against international law german soldiers forming part of isaf were regular combatants and therefore not criminally liable for acts of war permitted under international law the federal prosecutor general concluded that colonel liability under the code of crimes against international law_ notably its article no see paragraph below was excluded because colonel did not have the necessary intent to kill or harm civilians or damage civilian objects liability under the criminal code_ for murder but also for any other offence_ was excluded because the lawfulness of the air strike under international law served as an exculpatory defence press release summarising the main findings of the federal prosecutor general and indicating that most of the factual information was classified was issued on april redacted version of the discontinuation decision was prepared on october the discontinuation decision stated that the following pieces of evidence had been assessed comisaf investigation report with all annexes nato isaf provisions standard operating procedures_ rules of engagement_ tactical directives_ intelligence evaluation matrix_ special instructions for air and space operations report of the military police of september with annexes including photographs and video footage written statement by colonel of september made to the chief of staff of the german armed forces report by colonel member of the isaf fact finding team_ of september report of the representative of the kunduz region to the afghan president of september report of the afghan commission of inquiry to the afghan president united nations assistance mission in afghanistan unama list of potential civilian victims of the air strike non governmental organisation report of september classified report of the isaf initial action team of september minutes of the conversations at prt kunduz with the afghan commission of inquiry_ with local representatives and with delegation of the initial action team written statement by the operations command of the german armed forces of february in response to the questions by the federal prosecutor general of december file folders of the federal ministry of defence minutes of the meetings of the parliamentary defence committee sitting as first commission of inquiry_ in which the two suspects and captain were examined examinations of the two suspects as well as of the witnesses captain and staff sergeant by the federal prosecutor general minutes of the radio traffic between the pilots of the aircraft and staff sergeant and video footage the federal prosecutor general considered that two aspects_ in particular_ had to be clarified colonel subjective assessment of the situation when he ordered the air strike and the exact number of persons who had suffered death or injury as result he found credible colonel account that he had assumed that only taliban insurgents_ and no civilians_ had been located near the fuel tankers when he ordered the air strike it had been corroborated by large number of objective circumstances_ the statements of the persons who had been present at the command centre_ and the video footage from the aircraft prior to and during the air strike given that the release of the bombs had occurred at during ramadan_ with the nearest village located at least metres away_ in an area that was stronghold of the insurgents_ the presence of civilians would have seemed unlikely from the standpoint of an objective observer there had also been an intelligence warning regarding planned attack on the german base involving vehicles packed with explosives numerous such attacks had already been perpetrated in afghanistan in the months leading up to september colonel had had no reason to doubt the accuracy of the intelligence provided by the informant he had worked with that same informant only few days before and the information provided had been reliable captain through whom he had had at least seven calls put through to the informant in order to verify the evolution of the situation and to confirm that only insurgents were present at the scene_ had for his part regarded the informant as reliable the intelligence given by the informant corresponded to the video feed from the aircraft colonel conduct was in line with the care he had exercised on earlier occasions in taking decisions that might cause collateral damage to civilian life the other persons present at the command post had all credibly testified that they had operated on the assumption that only insurgents and no civilians had been present at the location it was unlikely that any additional insights as to whether or not colonel had acted in the expectation of civilian casualties when he ordered the air strike could be gleaned by examining additional witnesses captain who was also examined_ had been the only person present at the time the informant intelligence was transmitted and there were no indications that he had transmitted the said intelligence incorrectly the radio communication between the pilots and the command centre did not contain any indication that colonel had acted in the expectation of civilian casualties it had not been in dispute that the fuel tankers had been in the hands of taliban fighters and there were no indications that these fighters were no longer near the fuel tankers at the time of the air strike moreover_ as the taliban were from civilians based on attire_ it was not possible for the pilots to help establish whether it was visually apparent that the persons around the fuel tankers had included civilians in the case at hand_ the number of civilian casualties could not serve as circumstantial evidence from which colonel subjective expectations could be deduced the number of persons killed or injured by the air strike_ and how many of these were taliban or civilians_ could not be ascertained having regard to the divergent findings of the different reports in this respect_ the methods by which they had been established and the available evidence_ including the video material_ it was probable that about fifty persons had been killed or injured it was certain that two known taliban commanders were among those killed_ and the available reports allowed the conclusion that there were significantly more taliban than civilians among the victims it was not possible to clarify this matter further as the social and religious mores of the afghan population prevented use of modern forensic investigation techniques_ including the exhumation of bodies or dna analysis_ that would be required in any event the number of people present on the scene at the time of the air strike did not constitute reason to question colonel assumption that he was dealing exclusively with taliban fighters regarding colonel liability under the code of crimes against international law_ the federal prosecutor general considered that the air strike of september met the functional context requirement and the objective constituent elements of article no of the code_ as it constituted an attack by military means in connection with the non international armed conflict in afghanistan the subjective constituent elements of the offence_ by contrast_ were not present direct intent to cause collateral damage was required colonel had credibly testified that he had acted on the premise that only insurgents were present at the scene not only had he thus not expected damage to civilians with the certainty required by the provision he had_ in fact_ not expected such damage to occur at all the question of the of the expected collateral damage thus did not even arise the fuel tankers had been hijacked by an organised group of armed taliban fighters both the members of that group and the fuel tankers were legitimate military targets at the time colonel had ordered the air strike in respect of the taliban_ the federal prosecutor general explained that under international law all persons who had become functionally integrated into_ and exercised continuous combat function within_ an organised armed group were not civilians but legitimate military targets such persons could also be attacked outside the scope of ongoing hostilities until they had given up this combat function in lasting and conclusive manner see paragraph below the federal prosecutor general considered that general criminal law had remained applicable and concluded that his competence extended to prosecuting offences under the criminal code where the military action fell within the scope of the code of crimes against international law however colonel could also not be held liable under the criminal code_ and staff sergeant could not be liable for having aided and abetted colonel while the objective and subjective constituent elements of the offence of murder had been present_ colonel actions had been lawful under international law_ which served as an exculpatory defence in respect of military action the international humanitarian law status of the victims of the air strike was crucial for determining its lawfulness armed fighters affiliated with non state party to non international armed conflict and civilians participating directly in hostilities were legitimate targets for military attacks_ whereas civilians not directly participating in hostilities were not the armed taliban fighters who had hijacked the two fuel tankers and who probably accounted for most of the victims of the air strike were indeed members of an organised armed group that was party to the armed conflict they were thus legitimate military targets whose destruction was permissible within the bounds of military necessity_ in respect of which no restrictions could be inferred in the present case the air strike had also led to the killing of civilians who were protected under international humanitarian law and were not legitimate targets of military attack it could be accepted as premise that all those air strike victims who were not taliban fighters were civilians not taking direct part in the hostilities_ including those who were helping the taliban to free the fuel tankers from the sand bank and those who were trying to obtain fuel for their own benefit however_ colonel order to launch the air strike was legitimate under international law even considering that it had also killed civilians protected under international humanitarian law international humanitarian law only prohibited attacks launched against civilians as such or against military objective when the civilian damage to be expected at the time of ordering the attack was excessive to the expected_ actual and direct military advantage see paragraph below the military standard of that is to say the prohibition of excessiveness_ could not be equated with the stricter benchmark of lack of reasonableness the attacker objectively based expectation at the time of the military action was decisive_ both in respect of the tactical military advantage and foreseeable civilian collateral damage civilian collateral damage was relevant to the proportionality test only if commander had failed to take feasible precautions which would have enabled him to anticipate an event of major civilian collateral damage occurring in this sense could be imputed only in case of patent excess the air strike at issue had pursued two military objectives to destroy the fuel tankers and the fuel hijacked by the taliban and to kill taliban fighters given the circumstances known to colonel the distance of the sand bank from inhabited settlements_ the time of night and the presence of armed taliban and given the statements made by the informant_ colonel had had no reason to suspect the presence of protected civilians at the scene there had been no possibility of implementing further reconnaissance and or precautionary measures in timely manner the danger that the fuel tankers or the fuel would be recovered by the taliban was not one which colonel had been obliged to accept the circumstances provided sufficient indications that the persons in question were the legitimate target of military attack no absolute certainty was required however_ even assuming for the sake of argument that colonel ought to have anticipated the killing of several dozen protected civilians_ this would not have been out of all proportion to the expected military advantage nor would it have breached the precept to use the mildest possible means the question of means had in fact been discussed before the air strike among colonel staff sergeant and the pilots contrary to the latter recommendation to deploy heavier ordinance_ colonel had opted for the smallest bomb size available and for the use of delayed detonation fuses_ which limited the bombs effective range the conclusion that the attack order was permissible under international law was unaffected by the general obligation to give advance warnings before an attack that could potentially cause collateral damage to the civilian population not only had colonel been working on the justifiable assumption that the attack he had ordered would not hit any civilians_ but the aforementioned obligation could be dispensed with if the prevailing circumstances so dictated see paragraph below in the case at hand giving warning could have thwarted the legitimate military objective of killing the taliban fighters any alleged breach of internal rules such as the isaf rules of engagement_ which involved self imposed restriction in the interests of achieving long term political solution to the afghan conflict and which afforded higher level of protection to the civilian population than required under international law_ was irrelevant for evaluating the lawfulness of military conduct the applicant involvement in the investigation and his challenges to the discontinuation decision access to the investigation file on april the applicant_ through his legal representative_ filed criminal complaint with the federal prosecutor general regarding the death of_ inter alios_ his two sons he also requested access to the investigation file the applicant representative presented an authority to act on the applicant behalf_ as well as another authority entitling him to act on behalf of the relatives of further persons allegedly killed by the air strike by letter of april the federal prosecutor general informed the applicant representative that the criminal investigation had been discontinued in the meantime_ without the applicant having been heard_ and that the applicant request for access to the investigation file would require more detailed assessment concerning the applicant victim status the applicant subsequently made submissions by letters of june and july which the federal prosecutor general by letters of july and september rejected as ill founded on september the applicant legal representative limited his request for access to the investigation file_ previously made on behalf of all the persons he was representing_ to that of the applicant on september the applicant was granted access to the unclassified parts of the investigation file redacted version of the discontinuation decision was served on the applicant representative on october two days after it was finalised the applicant representative inspected the file at the federal prosecutor general office on october motion to compel public charges on november the applicant filed motion with the düsseldorf court of appeal seeking that public charges be brought against the suspects or_ in the alternative_ that the competent public prosecutor continue investigating the matter with view to determining their liability under the criminal code he submitted_ in particular_ that certain additional investigative measures were required to comprehensively establish the objective circumstances of the air strike on december the federal prosecutor general submitted his observations and moved for the motion to be dismissed as inadmissible for failure to comply with the formal requirements or_ in the alternative_ as ill founded on the basis that the applicant submissions could not establish sufficient ground for suspicion that the suspects were criminally liable refuting the applicant argument as to the alleged deficiencies of the investigation_ he maintained that all necessary investigative measures which offered any prospect of success had been carried out moreover_ even on the basis of the applicant factual submissions_ there would not have been breach of international humanitarian law on february the düsseldorf court of appeal dismissed the applicant motion to compel public charges as inadmissible it considered that the applicant submission did not satisfy the formal requirements see paragraph below the applicant had failed to discuss to sufficient extent or at all some of the evidence_ on which the federal prosecutor general discontinuation decision of october was based and which was listed there it was not clear from his submissions which pieces of evidence he had had_ and which he had not had_ access to contrary to his obligation to also present facts which may exonerate the suspects_ the applicant had limited himself to presenting selected parts of certain pieces of evidence_ in particular those which appeared to him to corroborate the accusations notably_ he had not thoroughly discussed the two page statement given by colonel to the chief of staff of september ii the report of the military police of september iii the minutes of the radio traffic between the pilots and staff sergeant immediately prior to the bomb release or iv the video footage from the aircraft_ and had not argued why the federal prosecutor general assessment of those pieces of evidence had allegedly been wrong in so far as the applicant had submitted that the non governmental organisation report_ to which he had been granted access_ had concluded that the air strike was unlawful and in breach of international humanitarian law_ he had failed to state the key considerations that led to this assessment the same held true for the applicant reference to the note of brigadier general of september as consequence_ his factual submissions did not enable the court of appeal to determine_ based on the applicant brief alone_ whether there was sufficient ground for suspicion against the suspects and hence reason to bring public charges the applicant had furthermore failed to offer suitable evidence_ or any evidence at all_ for number of submissions incriminating the suspects_ notably the allegation that the local informant had not been present at the sand bank_ that the pilots of the aircraft had demanded further reconnaissance_ that many civilians had been outside during the night of the air strike as it was ramadan_ and that the taliban insurgents normally acted in groups of ten individuals or less complaint of breach of the right to be heard on march the applicant filed complaint of breach of the right to be heard gehörsrüge in respect of the court of appeal order he asserted that the court of appeal had taken its decision without having given him the opportunity to comment on either the federal prosecutor general observations or those of defence counsel moreover_ it had not been foreseeable that he had to elaborate on his knowledge of specific pieces of evidence relied on by the federal prosecutor general and to present the essential content of those documents the court of appeal should have advised him accordingly prior to dismissing his motion in any event_ requiring him to discuss each and every piece of evidence relied on by the federal prosecutor general would render the motion to compel public charges ineffective_ given the scope of the file by order of march the court of appeal dismissed the applicant complaint as ill founded the decision of february had exclusively been based on the applicant submissions as such_ in order to establish whether the formal requirements had been complied with it had taken into account that he had been granted access to the investigation file in limited manner there had been no duty on the court to point out gaps in the applicant submissions_ as the time limit for the submission of the motion to compel public charges had expired and the formal defects could no longer be rectified proceedings before the federal constitutional court on march and april the applicant_ represented by counsel_ lodged constitutional complaints with the federal constitutional court the later complaint encompassed the earlier one and_ in addition_ challenged the court of appeal decision of march in alleging that the criminal investigation had been ineffective_ the applicant argued in particular that not all necessary investigative measures had been taken in order to comprehensively establish the objective circumstances of the air strike neither the applicant_ nor eyewitnesses_ nor military experts had been examined with view to determining whether the suspects could justifiably base their decision to order the air strike on the information available to them_ and whether sufficient precautionary measures had been taken the number of victims had not been established_ nor had there been medical reports on the cause of death moreover_ the applicant as the next of kin of two victims of the air strike had been insufficiently involved in the proceedings_ in view of the limited and delayed access to the investigation file_ the failure to be heard_ the delay in the service of the federal prosecutor general discontinuation decision and the excessive admissibility requirements applied by the court of appeal on december the federal constitutional court refused to admit the constitutional complaint for adjudication no bvr in so far as it concerned access to the investigation file the applicant did not challenge this decision in the present application on may the federal constitutional court refused to admit the constitutional complaint for adjudication no bvr in so far as it concerned the effectiveness of the criminal investigation_ finding that it was_ in any event_ ill founded while the applicant had right to an effective criminal investigation_ both the discontinuation decision of the federal prosecutor general and the decision of the düsseldorf court of appeal in respect of his motion to compel public charges had satisfied the respective requirements the discontinuation decision of the federal prosecutor general had neither misjudged the importance of the right to life and the resulting obligations of the state to protect it nor the requirement to carry out an effective investigation into deaths as defined by the case law of the federal constitutional court and of the european court of human rights the federal prosecutor general decision had described the investigations that he had carried out and concluded that there were insufficient indications to establish reasonable grounds for suspicion that decision had mainly been based on the presumption that the suspects had been convinced_ at the time of ordering the air strike_ that the persons in the immediate vicinity of the fuel tankers were armed insurgents_ which excluded the intent required for liability under article no of the code of crimes against international law that determination had not been arbitrary and thus did not warrant objections under constitutional law additional investigatory measures_ such as the examination of witnesses who had observed the air strike_ would not have changed this the bombing itself and the deaths of numerous civilians had never been in doubt the key aspect of the decision to discontinue the investigation had been that it could not be proven that the suspects knew with certainty that the air strike would injure or even kill civilians neither that finding nor the investigations carried out to that end raised concerns under constitutional law lastly_ the federal prosecutor general position that he was also competent to investigate offences under the criminal code that might have been committed through the same act that led him to investigate offences under the code of crimes against international law was not arbitrary the federal constitutional court further held that the düsseldorf court of appeal decision of february did not raise concerns under constitutional law either the investigations that had been carried out and their documentation by the federal prosecutor general satisfied constitutional requirements subsequent review decision by court thus could not result in breach of the right to an effective criminal investigation in this respect_ it was not decisive whether the court had dismissed the motion to compel public charges as inadmissible or as ill founded_ as long as an examination of the challenged decision to discontinue the investigation could be discerned the court of appeal had dismissed that motion as inadmissible_ but the manner and the scope of the court of appeal reasoning showed that it had conducted detailed examination of the federal prosecutor general discontinuation decision and the investigations documented therein moreover_ the federal constitutional court found that the court of appeal decision had not misjudged the importance and scope of the applicant right to effective protection of his legal interests grundrecht auf effektiven rechtsschutz the requirements applied by the court of appeal in respect of the content of the motion to compel public charges did not raise concerns under constitutional law in this respect as the applicant had_ to significant extent_ based his motion seeking to compel public charges on the content of the investigation file_ he had to provide the essential content of the pieces of evidence which he cited otherwise the legislature intent that the competent court had to be able to examine the motion conclusiveness solely based on the brief itself would be undermined selective_ or even distorted_ representation of parts of suspect account or of witness examinations could create an inaccurate image of the result of the investigation which could not easily be corrected this might oblige the applicant to also submit information on circumstances which could exonerate suspect in the present case_ the applicant had not satisfied these requirements lastly_ the court of appeal decision had not breached the applicant right to be heard in this respect_ the federal constitutional court endorsed the reasons advanced by the court of appeal in its order of march the federal constitutional court decision was served on the applicant counsel on july other investigations after comisaf learned of the air strike on the morning of september he initiated an investigation the so

been directed at the insurgents and had succeeded in weakening the taliban network the united nations assistance mission in afghanistan unama collected information about possible victims of the air strike it compiled list with personal details of deceased and injured in addition_ it reported on the air strike in its annual report unama_ annual report on protection of civilians in armed conflict january as follows air strike against hijacked oil tankers in aliabad district_ kunduz province on september_ group of taliban hijacked two fuel tankers along the main kunduz baghlan road they tried

invited nearby villagers to collect the fuel as the villagers were siphoning off the fuel_ several hours later_ in the early hours of the morning of september_ an air strike was conducted investigations were complicated as result of the ensuring sic fireball_ which incinerated large number of people making identification extremely difficult it is not disputed that some taliban were at the site but it should have been apparent that many civilians were also in the vicinity of the trucks according to unama hr investigations_ civilians_ including many children_ were killed the international committee of the red cross icrc also investigated the air strike from september onwards and submitted confidential report to isaf on october on december the german parliament established commission of inquiry to assess_ inter alia_ whether the air strike was in compliance with the mandate given by parliament to the german armed forces_ with the operative planning and with the applicable orders and rules of engagement on october the commission concluded its investigation and published its report as to the number of victims of the air strike_ it noted that different reports indicated between and deceased to civilians and to injured persons to civilians regarding the question of compliance with the applicable orders and rules of engagement_ it came to the conclusion that colonel made certain procedural mistakes when ordering the air strike_ and partially violated the applicable isaf rules of engagement consequently_ based on the information available to the commission_ the air strike could not be considered proportionate and should not have been ordered however_ the commission also stated that colonel acted at the relevant time to the best of his knowledge and to protect his soldiers therefore his decision to order the air strike was comprehensible civil proceedings for compensation the applicant together with another individual lodged civil action for compensation against the federal republic of germany in connection with the killing of their relatives by the air strike of september after the bonn regional court had rejected the action and the plaintiffs appeal before the cologne court of appeal had been to no avail_ the federal court of justice_ by judgment of october rejected as ill founded the plaintiffs appeal on points of law it left open the question whether germany could be sued for military operations of the bundeswehr under nato operational command however_ it found_ firstly_ that the plaintiffs_ as individuals_ could not claim compensation from germany for breach of international humanitarian law based directly on international law such right could_ as rule_ only be exercised by their state it found_ secondly_ that german law on state liability was not applicable to harm done to foreign citizens by the german armed forces in the framework of deployment to an armed conflict overseas irrespective of this question of applicability_ such claim by the plaintiffs was ruled out in any event because there had been no breach of official duty by german soldier or authority_ notably no culpable breach of the rules of international humanitarian law by colonel the court of appeal had not erred in law when it determined_ basing itself on the facts established by the regional court_ that the presence of civilians at the site of the air strike had not been objectively foreseeable for colonel at the time of ordering the air strike_ all feasible precautionary measures having been taken the federal constitutional court declined to consider the applicant constitutional complaint lodged in respect of these civil proceedings file no bvr order of november delivered on december relevant legal

purpose the context for the purpose of the interpretation of treaty shall comprise_ in addition to the text_ including its preamble and annexes any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other

the application of its provisions any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties special meaning shall be given to term if it is established that the parties so intended case law of the international court of justice in its advisory opinion on the legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons july the international court of justice stated as follows the court observes that the protection of the international covenant for the protection of civil and political rights does not cease in times of war_ except by operation of article of the covenant whereby certain provisions may be derogated from in time of national emergency respect for the right to life_ however_ is not such provision in principle_ the right not arbitrarily to be deprived of one life applies also in hostilities the test of what is an arbitrary deprivation of life_ however_ falls to be determined by the applicable lex specialis_ namely_ the law applicable in armed conflict which is designed to regulate the conduct of hostilities thus whether particular loss of life_ through the use of certain weapon in warfare_ is to be considered an arbitrary deprivation of life contrary to article of the covenant_ can only be decided by reference to the law applicable in armed conflict and not deduced from the terms of the covenant itself the submission of the exercise of the right of self defence to the conditions of necessity and proportionality is rule of customary international law as the court stated in the case concerning military and paramilitary activities in and against nicaragua nicaragua united states of america there is specific rule whereby self defence would warrant only measures which are proportional to the armed attack and necessary to respond to it_ rule well established in customary international law reports para this dual condition applies equally to article of the charter_ whatever the means of force employed in its advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of wall in the occupied palestinian territory july the international court of justice rejected israel argument that the human rights instruments to which it was party were not applicable to occupied territory_ and held the court considers that the protection offered by human rights conventions does not cease in case of armed conflict_ save through the effect of provisions for derogation of the kind to be found in article of the international covenant on civil and political rights as regards the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law_ there are thus three possible situations some rights may be exclusively matters of international humanitarian law others may be exclusively matters of human rights law yet others may be matters of both these branches of international law in order to answer the question put to it_ the court will have to take into consideration both these branches of international law_ namely human rights law and_ as lex specialis_ international humanitarian law in its judgment concerning armed activities on the territory of the congo democratic republic of congo uganda december the international court of justice held as follows the court_ having established that the conduct of the updf uganda people defence force and of the officers and soldiers of the updf is attributable to uganda_ must now examine whether this conduct constitutes breach of uganda international obligations in this regard_ the court needs to determine the rules and principles of international human rights law and international humanitarian law which are relevant for this purpose the court first recalls that it had occasion to address the issues of the relationship between international humanitarian law and international human rights law and of the applicability of international human rights law instruments outside national territory in its advisory opinion of july on the legal consequences of the construction of wall in the occupied palestinian territory in this advisory opinion the court found that the protection offered by human rights conventions does not cease in case of armed conflict_ save through the effect of provisions for derogation of the kind to be found in article of the international covenant on civil and political rights as regards the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law_ there are thus three possible situations some rights may be exclusively matters of international humanitarian law others may be exclusively matters of human rights law yet others may be matters of both these branches of international law reports para it thus concluded that both branches of international law_ namely international human rights law and international humanitarian law_ would have to be taken into consideration the court further concluded that international human rights instruments are applicable in respect of acts done by state in the exercise of its jurisdiction outside its own territory particularly in occupied territories ibid pp paras international humanitarian law article of the protocol additional to the geneva conventions of august and relating to the protection of

effective advance warning of attacks which may affect the civilian population_ unless circumstances do not permit_ such as in cases where the element of surprise is essential to the success of an

practically possible_ taking into account all circumstances prevailing at the time_ including humanitarian and military considerations the four geneva conventions of and their additional protocol i_
