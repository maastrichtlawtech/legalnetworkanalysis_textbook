Tom,5,A really interesting perspective on the world's neighborhoods and how world events have left some damage but much is on repair. The line that stuck with me is how many 'diverse' communities are not as much living together as they are side by side. Its an easy read as the author is most articulate. Good to know this kind of work is being done in the world.
Merrie,5,This is a remarkable book with observations that will stick with you long after you've read it. From a discussion on 'voice rights' to parallel living we all can learn from this.
Tatler,4,"Perceptive, well-written by qualified analyst. Limits omit role of sports (not part of Carnegie Foundation's concern, which might or might not support doing more case studies.)
"
Nissim,5,"The book is very important because it exposes the moral virtues as something affordable to anyone, by repeating acts related to them"
Regina,5,Very good
Nir,5,"great book, fascinating, lucidly-presented arguments. highly recommended."
David,4,"This is a moving and humane reflection on morality, and how our immediate moral sensibilities provide both a source of strength and also an obstacle to the spread of more universalistic values. My only complaint is that I thought the introduction promised more by way of careful case studies, but what we get are quick fly-overs: Ignatieff and his Carnegie Council pals drop into a city, talk to some leaders, take a tour, and that's about it. And on that basis he's prone to saying things like, everyone in Los Angeles wants such-and-such, as if he spoke to everyone. But eventually it became apparent that this was more a personal reflection of a veteran observer than sociology, and on those terms it succeeds quite well."
Richard,1,"The author sincerely believes that if we proles only practice the ordinary virtues: trust, tolerate,forgive, reconcile and be resilient as taught by the global elite we will pull the world out of the mess globalization has produced. Well maybe he is right. But as the saying goes “fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me.”"
Tapas,3,"It is a book about the modern globalized world and the problems faced by immigrants and how they assimilate etc.Not a book on virtues .Disappointed .The title is misleading. I was expecting. Aristotle, Plato, Epicurus, etc."
