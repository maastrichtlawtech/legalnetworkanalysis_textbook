Welcome to this introduction in Legal Network Analysis. The aim of this introduction is to provide you with a theoretical and practical understanding of what network analysis is, what it can be used for in the context of legal research, and how it can be applied. 

The theory will be discussed and illustrated by means of practical examples and sometimes exercises. We try to accommodate readers with different levels of proficiency in coding:
- If you have no coding (in Python) experience, you can read the PDF (or the notebook) and simply skip the code that is displayed.
- If you have experience with running code (e.g. in Jupyter Notebook or VScode), you can execute the code. We have entered the code for you, which means you only have to run the code.
- If you have experience with Python, you may download the Jupyter Notebook file and alter the code.

The textbook aims to introduce network analysis to legal scholars in a comprehensive and practical way. If you are interested in more background information regarding networks, their analysis and the graph theory underlying it, please feel free to consult the books listed below. We selected publications that are accessible when you are not yet versed in network analysis.

The code-part of the textbook is done exclusively in [NetworkX](https://github.com/networkx/networkx). Since this library is  pure python, it is easier to read its source code and that transparency matters for understanding. Faster libraries are available for those who need them, but that remains for the reader to explore.

For dependencies (besides the usual stuff) make sure you have up to date versions of: 
* [networkx](https://pypi.org/project/networkx/)
* [pydot](https://pypi.org/project/pydot/)
* [text-distance](https://pypi.org/project/textdistance/)
