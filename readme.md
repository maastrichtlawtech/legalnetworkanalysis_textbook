# Legal Network Analysis Textbook

**Work in progress, do not cite or share**

This is meant to be an introdcution to network analysis for jurists.
It will be most useful for those who already know some Python, but anyone can get some insight out of it, including non-jurists. 

The math is mostly rudimentary and can be safely skipped. However it is there if you want it. In this way, the textbook occupiies an intermediate spot in the literature, between very basic manuals, and very advanced ones.

The "nitty-gritty" of the textbook is done exclusively in [NetworkX](https://github.com/networkx/networkx). Since this library is  pure python, it is easier to read its source code and that transparency matters for understanding. Faster libraries are available for those who need them, but that remains for the reader to explore.

The purpose of this work is to provide aspiring legal analysts (Cfr. [Farnsworth 2007](https://www.amazon.com/Legal-Analyst-Toolkit-Thinking-about/dp/0226238350)) with more than just a hammer, with a tool to see in the dark.

The textbook is present as a single file in the main branch of the repo.
