# To do list



1. Double check of using latex for mention of variables (v, w) within paragraphs
2. Double check closeness / betweeness (sum of path lenghts, vs sum of paths)
3. all images should just be images in the pdf, and not code generated, unless there is a "follow along"  reason for giving the code  alternatively create a section on plotting --> should go on Chapter 2
4. Check notation on repeat multiplication formulas

5. Tighten talk of normalization thorought
6. Amsterdam is the most intuitive example of a high Eigenvector centrality node, it has direct connections to important stations, but it is not super centric in itself
7. Consider changing all dataframe output to pd.DataFrame.from_dict in order to make code shorter
8. Create a folder with the latex data all in there
