# To do list



1. Pydot is deprecated. I need a new layout for the obergefell plot.
2. Double check of using latex for mention of variables (v, w) within paragraphs
3. Double check closeness / betweeness (sum of path lenghts, vs sum of paths)
4. all images should just be images in the pdf, and not code generated, unless there is a "follow along"  reason for giving the code  alternatively create a section on plotting
5. Check notation on repeat multiplication formulas
