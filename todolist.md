# To do list

All notebooks run sequentially. Pending issues remain

1. Spellchecking
2. Consider deleting appendixes for publication (move to a nightly branch)
3. Graphviz and pydot are problematic. Pydot is deprecated. Find a replacement for directed graphs, especially g_obergefell
4. The legal history plot is not nice. Nx does not have gephi visualizations like force atlas. Would it be ok to just add an image from Gephi?
